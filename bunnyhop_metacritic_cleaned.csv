Super Mario 64 is a masterpiece in the truest sense of the word.|This is definitely a game no game collection should be without...Seriously!|Complete in every way, and the challenging experience of working toward each new level is far greater than the game's minimal flaws. Nintendo's craftsmanship and zeal for creating fantastically enjoyable games has never shown through more than in Super Mario 64.|I haven't met anybody who hasn't wasted at least half an hour just running around outside the castle, sliding, jumping, stomping, diving, swimming... There are no enemies here and there's really nothing to do, but boy is it fun!|There'll never be another Mario game that will make the same impact as Super Mario 64.

I think 7 stars in one level is more than enough, don't you think? I understand that there are memory constraints, but there either could have been less stars overall, or 1 (maybe 2) more level(s).

It's a whole new level of gaming. The amazing performance and features of Quake are the future of gaming. Whether you are new to this type of game or you are an old ""Doom"" hack, you will fall in love with Quake.|The graphics, sound, and intelligence factors combine to make a game that will scare the hell out of you! The main problem that Quake seems to have is a lack of identity. It wants to combine ""DOOM"" elements with Hexen elements which creates a mish-mash effect.|Quake is fun. Quake is cool. Quake is the best game of its type I have ever seen. Quake won't let me sleep at night. However, Quake could be better.|Quake isn't destined to revolutionize action games, but it's a very good first-person shooter from the guys who invented the genre.

The gameplay is the easiest I've ever come across in an RPG which is just fantastic.|Diablo is the perfect example of a game that transcends its genre.|The hundreds of beautifully rendered monstrosities, items and labyrinths will keep you on your toes for months. Blizzard is also one of the first software companies to offer FREE MULTI-PLAYER GAMING.|By far the shortest RPG I've ever played. Surprisingly, this may be one of its strengths. An RPG that only takes about thirty hours (or much less if you are experienced) to play is easy to play again. And Diablo has serious replayability virtues. [Grade = A+]|Hands-down, the best game I've seen in years...The fantastic design, intuitive gameplay, spectacular graphics, inspired music and sound effects, sheer number of monsters and unique items, and the free Battle.net service put Diablo at a high level of excellence that future releases may never reach.|A title that combines the elegant simplicity of an action game and the addictive storyline of an adventure game with the personalization and exploratoration of an old-school RPG... The best game to come out in the past year, and you should own a copy. Period.|RPG fans have waited for this one for a long time, and they won't be disappointed. [March 1997, p.102]|For a highly addictive, replayable game, facing the Lord of Terror is somewhat of an anti-climax. Provided you've played as a Rogue and have the Bow of the Bear it's pretty simple to kill him off. Playing the Warrior though is a little harder.|While Diablo is easy to get into, it doesn't hold too much charm after you have put many hours into it.

Never shall I pass a security camera again without itching to disable it with a pinpoint accurate shot. Altering a person's perception is not an easy thing to do and qualities like that make for some very interesting art.|One can't go without mentioning the fantastic multiplayer mode. Unlike PC shooters, where ambush seems to be the name of the game, GoldenEye concentrates on fast, frantic fun. Everyone can see each other's screen, and radar is provided for additional assistance, so hiding is a virtual impossibility.|Play GoldenEye one time and youll be jonesin for James harder than Grace Jones on a lonely night. Its one of the best movie-to-game translations ever.|Bar none this is the greatest console game ever made...

[Jan 2004, p.189]|Overall, GoldenEye, while being a good corridor shooter, is a corridor shooter, nonetheless. I have no problem with Nintendo releasing quality games, but I think it's time they expand the horizons of the system a little.|One of the best first person shooters ever.|Its strategy and story mixed in with the action make it a fantastic gaming experience.|It has all those essential elements that good games need, and all those elements are slightly less than perfect.|7 / 8 / 8 / 8 - 31 silver"

One hitch, however, is that the skill level gets progressively harder - so hard that casual gamers might give up rather quickly.|Ocarina of Time is the complete package appealing to one and all, and is the definitive accomplishment in game design.|A truly remarkable achievement. Nintendo have created a beautiful game world and breathed life into it with puzzles, secrets, enemies, and loveable characters that will completely engross gamers around the globe.

Oh yes, Zelda 64 does indeed own your soul.|Nothing but pure 100% fun, challenging, and lengthy.|Call us crazy, but when the final version of Zelda 64 arrived in the IGN64 offices, we stopped working, locked ourselves into a room with a big-screen TV and a surround system and played 17 hours straight. After only a few hours of sleep, we were back for more and we couldn't stop until we finished the game. Then, we started over again to find all the secrets.|[Review Score = 110]  What's significant about this convergence of audio, graphics and gameplay is that you are COMPLETELY IMMERSED in Zelda's world.

Epic. Unstoppable. Unbeatable. Irresistible. Sensational...The best videogame I have ever played. It is the crowning jewel of the industry. It is Nintendo's finest achievement.|When it comes to what people will now demand of a top videogame, Nintendo has moved the goalposts off the pitch, into a lorry, down the road, into the airport, onto a plane and halfway round the world to a different continent entirely.|Featuring unparalleled 3D environments, a deep and involved quest, brilliant and intuitive play controls, and a well-developed cinematic quality that enhances rather than overwhelms the whole game experience, Miyamoto's latest soon-to-be-classic title deserves to be played by each and every person who might deign to consider themselves a fan of great games.|The player will be drawn into the Zelda fantasy world from the moment the opening sequence bursts onto the screen, and the game won't let go-not even after finishing the quest.|Realism is one of the major reasons this title is so amazing.

""Tekken 2"" was a 10, and Tekken 3 is a better game in most respects.|In order to outshine Tekken 3, a game will need to have a ton of moves (T3 has over 100 per character), multi-hit combos (all T3 fighters can pull off 10-hitters), outstanding graphics (T3 has no breakup on the fighters, no ""blind spots"" where clipping occurs, and no slowdown), and seamless gameplay that includes juggles, counters, and linking moves.|If you want to pick a fight, why not battle with the best of 'em?

It was probably the least confusing part of the story.

The AI could be better, but everything else kicks too much ass to worry about it.|The lack of any kind of weather (wet roads isn't a weather condition, merely a clever effect), the frame-skipping problems (it just shouldn't exist!), and the lack of car damage (erm… this is a simulation, right?) drags the score down from the high nineties. Still, this game is without a doubt the best racer on any platform.|While it has its flaws, is by far the best console racer on the planet, and betters its predecessors in nearly every respect.|At some point, refinement becomes self-defeating as gamers grow tired of overused concepts. Unfortunately, GT3 simply does not offer anything new or unique. Where will the creative minds of developers take simulators in the future?

The liberties taken with the physics keeps the game from being the true simulation most gamers think it is.|While it is easily one of the most comprehensive and visually solid racing games to date, I found the fact that it's basically a repackaged ""Gran Turismo 2"" a little hard to swallow. If you can look past that, this is the game for you.|While GT2 features over 500 cars, GT3 contains only a fraction of that number. In fact, the original Gran Turismo holds more cars (166) than the advertised 150+ cars of GT3. Enthusiasts will be sorely disappointed, but trust me, 150+ cars is still pretty hefty. Also missing is the used car lot.|You can see and do just about everything this game has to offer without ever coming close to finishing it. Only the most diligent racers will have the patience to muddle their way through the entire simulation mode.|GT3's soundtrack is a mixed bag. Some of it is boring-yet-harmless original music that is surprisingly jazzy.

This game has the potential to last months and months on end, especially for the 100% target.|The story to San Andreas is by far the best of any GTA game to date. As you progress, you will experience turning points to this story that drive you to see the next cutscene, something that has never been done in a GTA game before.|The game’s targeting system has been improved and is very reminiscent of the developer’s ""Manhunt,"" which overall makes it more cohesive. The game allows you to get better with guns and you’ll have different phases, which will give you more control over your shooting abilities.|While I can't say that GTA: San Andreas is another revolution in gaming like GTA3 was, it is an evolution that goes light years beyond what we saw with the last two titles in the series.|Only the graphical bugs, slow-down and other nit picks associated with the fact that the game is pushing the aging PS2 to its limits keeps this from being the first perfect entry into the series.|Thanks to the sheer level of detail and the amount of gameplay you'll be able to engage in during C.J.'s adventures, San Andreas surpasses just about any game that’s come along in the PS2’s history.|The amount of attributes that you can actually improve is staggering. CJ must learn how to drive, shoot, swim, workout, be healthy, sprint and participate in relationships.|With its strong story, well-written dialogue, terrific voice cast, impressive graphics, great in-game sound, and extremely entertaining and varied gameplay, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is a stupendous thrill ride that shouldn't be missed.|This could very well be remembered as the PlayStation 2's best game ever.|As far as actual content goes, I don’t think there’s been a game in history with more, so you almost need to own this game just so you can see how packed a game can be.|When you take the scope of the entire game into considerations, San Andreas is a real technical feat.|It is hard to find a game with the perfect blend of unique, action packed missions and interesting and enthralling non-mission events, but Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas pulls it off in convincing fashion.|There's so much to do in this game that it's outside of my range of imagination to be able to picture me reaching a 100% complete. Unfathomable.|The second you start playing this game you realise that the latest Rockstar title is about a hundred times more complex than its predecessors. Not only is there a load of new weapons, cars and a huge new environment available, but the gaming experience itself has completely evolved.|It is, in my opinion, the best single player experience available right now.|A weaker soundtrack and nagging problems with the interface take the game down just shy of getting a full 10, but this is the digital embodiment of a killer app.|Calling this game huge is an understatement...All told, San Andreas is about four times the size of any previous GTA game.|This is arguably the most important videogame this year - yes, even more important than ""Halo 2"" - not only because it's a superbly crafted videogame, but because it's also a bona fide sociological artifact, one that manages to effectively evoke a specific time and place in American history—in this case, a hot and hazy California during the nascent days of hip-hop culture.|The minor control problems, reoccurring graphical bugs, and the generally similar core gameplay as before keep the game's score down a tad from what it could be, but the ridiculous amount of content and pure value available here is second to none. It doesn’t completely redefine the series.|A masterful blend of storyline, exciting action, and freeform gameplay that will keep you hooked for hours on end.|There is personality and atmosphere everywhere in this game and even small things such as the body language of pedestrians sets the scene in every neighbourhood you visit.|Surprisingly easy to pick up, and startlingly difficult to master, San Andreas offers the most complete gaming package ever made on the current generation of consoles.|No one should deny that San Andreas is a great storytelling game. It's just that, between gradually caring less and less about the main characters, and performing many game actions that are nearly identical to those of previous titles in the series, San Andreas could easily begin to wear a bit thin.|This game has so many new innovations that it leaves its predecessors in the dust.|My biggest beef with San Andreas is the implementation of the gang warfare system...It takes away a certain element that was found in the earlier games, that of the feeling that you were running an entire city.|Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is to the gaming world what ""The Matrix"" was to the film industry: it breaks so much ground and introduces so many significant things that it will no doubt have an impact on how games are made for a long time to come.|GTA may be looking its age and some of its more favoured structural ideas are beginning to feel a little dated, but Rockstar continue to revel in the mastery of presenting a consuming environment to the player and inviting them to do within it what they wish.|San Andreas's chief advantage over ""Vice City"" is size. And for many players, that's good enough. But another group of fans will come to quietly understand that, at least for the time being, ""Vice City"" remains the high point of the GTA series.|The fact that you can do whatever you want, gunning down rival gang members, impressing the girls, robbing the rich, breaking into the Army Depot, whether it is flying a plane, or pimping out your car, playing some pool, riding across country, the game play is endless.|As with previous GTA games there's lots to criticise, but San Andreas survives, scathed but still walking tall, buoyed by the kind of ambition that sees most games crumble under the weight of it all. It's a multi-faceted, multi-achieving experience, a rough-edged but massively substantial landmark. [Christmas 2004, p.78]|I have to subtract a point for what, in my opinion, is a total lack of overall upgrading. While there are hundreds of more things to do in San Andreas, I feel, in my heart of hearts, that the game looks and plays just like its two predecessors.|One of the game's biggest achievements, however, is that it actually gets you to care about Carl and his friends - the other gang members who ride and fight with you on most missions. They all seem to have their own personalities and come across as being fully-realized characters.|There is also a distinct lack of overall polish, mostly noticeable in the smallest ways: ugly character models, cluttered maps (the custom waypoint is a welcomed and downright necessary addition), unnecessarily complex wardrobe management, odd misspellings (""Cobra Marital Arts""), and even repeated references to Los Angeles instead of Los Santos.|San Andreas' greatest success is that it gives us more space for our imaginations than most other games do, and ties together the edges neatly with a well-crafted story and missions, adding up to a whole that few games can compare to.|San Andreas is a true epic, but no game should be this frustrating.|The seamless way in which the DJs react to the in-game environment, and from an intertextual standpoint, merge better with the player's situation far more effectively than in the previous games is just inspiring.|Enormous, diverse, engrossing, daring, liberating, sophisticated and -- most of all -- ambitious. Yet at the same time it can be restrictive, banal, childish, unpolished and -- most of all -- frustrating.|What you have here is the most polished, feature-laden, action-packed Grand Theft Auto title to-date. I've had my qualms with the franchise in the past but this is the first time that I was able to sit back, shut off my brain and enjoy the experience.|Between its towering mountains and vast waters there are surprises, in-jokes and events in San Andreas to fill at least a hundred hours. Should ""GTA4"" be any more involving, there’ll be no one left to see how GTA5 turns out. Half of us will no longer have the jobs to afford it; the other half will be motoring back and forth in the neighbours’ stolen car, endlessly prowling for prostitutes.|It's no exaggeration to say that you could be still be playing this when the next GTA game comes out, even if it takes Rockstar another two years to finish. It's not perfect then, but so much of it is so good that you won't care.|Your legacy will be as twisted, as exciting or as brutal as your imagination will allow... San Andreas is an experience as unique as you are. Sometimes, it’s okay to believe the hype. [Christmas 2004, p.98]|The amount of things to do in the cities of Los Santos, San Fierro, and Las Venturas is absolutely staggering... In my opinion there’s no excuse to not have a “save anywhere” feature included.|Bigger and richer in every way - a near bottomless game painted end-to-end with stuff to do, or not. As far as free-form gaming goes, it remains the pinnacle. [Jan 2005, p.57]|A thrilling, albeit frustrating, gaming experience that will have you yelling for joy one minute then screaming in anger the next.|Visually, San Andreas is pretty lackluster. The game doesn't display a single ""wow"" element in its visuals. The framerate is still too jerky and the pop-up is absolutely disastrous.|How can a rehash of the same basic formula prove so successful? As GTA:SA has taught me, one does so by taking the best parts of a given game, improving them, and then adding a ridiculous amount of new features and content.|It would feel truer to the game's open environmental design if you could have more general goals: kill an enemy when and how you like; raise money for an objective through any method available; challenge random people to races.|"

[Online review]|Halo 2 online is not total perfection, but it's miles better than anything out there right now, by a long long way... It's a genuine milestone in online console gaming. [Multiplayer Review]|Halo 2's Campaign mode is a luminous experience and testament of Bungie's rare talent for mixing gorgeous cinematics with captivating and fun gameplay segments, but it also serves as the concrete foundation for the game's multiplayer, making simple deathmatches, team skirmishes and CTF games that much more engaging.|The new ""Dual Wielding"" option allows you to pick up two guns at once and use them together, which provides a feeling that again, other shooters just don't come anywhere near.|Quite simply an indescribably phenomenal gaming experience that redefines both the first person shooter genre and next generation gaming.|This game goes where no Xbox Live enabled game has gone before.|The graphics are hotter than ever, and the bump-mapping technology, which gives even simple textures an illusion of depth and reality, looks even better than you could've imagined.|The combination of a great campaign mode along with a goldmine of multiplayer options makes for an unbeatable gaming experience.|Simply put, Halo 2 is by far the greatest first-person shooter the console world has seen to date...Nothing I say can prepare you for this game. [Dec 2004, p.180]|From the huge gameplay twist early on, to taking down a giant walking tank, to way late in the game when you team up with certain...teammates, all the way to an end that'll leave you with the same breathless feeling you had when you first watched ""The Empire Strikes Back""...moments like these turn a fun game into a monumental experience.|The campaign mode introduces a ton of new elements, not only to the game itself, but also to the Halo universe as a whole. As for the multiplayer, you won't find a better Xbox Live experience anywhere, and you can be sure that Halo 2 will be topping the Live charts for years to come.|Unlike October's blockbuster ""Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas,"" Halo's masses of content have been tossed in a strainer and all serve to make the main game better, rather than simply providing more for the player to do.|The Multiplayer is so incredibly fun that when you have a large group of people over playing you lose track of time and can (from personal experience) spend over 17 hours straight playing Multiplayer without realizing it.|Utterly essential.|But where the sequel will really fondle your boys is in the multiplayer modes. New level designs let you funnel the action into wide-open areas or allow you to stalk the terrain's nooks and crannies looking for the perfect sniping spot.|The sound in Halo 2 is the best I have ever heard in any game... Each weapon has such a distinctive sound now that you know what is going on in the next room before you even get there, from the rattle of a SMG to the haunting whistling of a Hunter's beam.|From the deep stat tracking to the games ability to match you up with people your own ability,the clan and party support, and huge number of game modes, Halo 2's multiplayer is definitely a revolution for console multiplayer games.|Oh, but the best weapon of all, my friends, is the new Energy Sword, a shimmering, supersized beauty. The sword crackles and sizzles, almost like the darned thing is angry.|The multiplayer promises to elevate Halo 2 online gameplay to ""Counter-Strike"" status with the added attraction of Xbox Live full voice support.|Halo 2 completely lives up to the hype. An improvement in every way over the original, particularly in terms of playability and graphics.|I can say with complete honesty that no other first-person shooter can touch Bungie's epic in terms of level design, gunplay, sheer action or multiplayer entertainment.|A near-flawless fusion of solid gameplay and excellent presentation, filled with little details that make it a kill-the-light-and-unplug-the-phone experience.|The best console multiplayer component ever. This game is going to douse Xbox Live in gasoline and toss it a match...With 16 players busting each other's chops at a time and all the clan support you can handle, this game will still be played five years from now.|Living up to its unbelievable hype, Bungie's masterpiece features an engaging story, a satisfying single-player campaign, some of the most impressive graphics ever seen in a console title, and new gameplay features like dual-wielding, vehicle boarding, new weapons, and advanced AI.|This is a quality sci-fi blockbuster brought alive with sleek visuals, superb voice characterisations, explosive sound effects and a robustly stirring music score.|The epic scale astounds, with dazzling scenery including space stations, war-torn cities, temples, snowy wastelands and ruins. The audio is equally extravagant.|Everything's designed with a master's eye for first-person intensity, extensively crafted and technicaly superb. [Dec 2004,p.75]|The visuals are amazing and the audio production is stunning. One word for the multiplayer game modes…perfection.|While feature-packed, Halo 2's Live interface will take a little getting used to. It's not that it's laid out poorly or anything like that. It's just that the sheer number of options you have available to you for Live play are staggering.|Enemies will change what they say based on what's happening too, so if you go in guns blazing they may scream like a little girl, but if you duck behind an object they will taunt you for being a coward. All of this adds to the total immersion that you get from playing this game and that feeling is overwhelming.|Halo 2 has delivered and conquered every front it set out to take. No other game is as cinematic. No other game sounds like Halo 2 does and no other game plays as fantastic as Halo 2 plays. You will not find a better multiplayer game on any platform.|Each level is of a perfect length as the player finishes just as he or she feels they are getting bored yet has an addictive quality to them which makes you want to play it again and again.|It's a noble achievement in storytelling, gameplay balance, and multiplayer design. And it's easily the best console-based, online game on Earth. Easily. Like so many people have said thus far: In 2004, Halo 2 will own you.|A graphical and audible masterpiece on so many different levels. I don't even know where to begin. Halo 2 has been completely rebuilt from the ground up. This is NOT Halo 1 with new textures.  The graphics are simply stunning and the draw-in distance is as far as the eye could see.|The fluidity with which characters, vehicles, bullets and environmental objects move is astonishing, and when you couple that smoothness with location-specific Havok physics, the game looks much more believable than the first Halo, if not any game to date.|Like the first game, you will be talking about the end of Halo 2 for a long time to come, perhaps for the wrong reasons though this time and many gamers will feel maybe a bit ripped off? But the fantastic moments in Halo 2 far outweigh the few flaws.|Most of the new additions in the game aren't innovative on their own, but like with the original, Bungie combines almost everything that makes the FPS genre fantastic into one, nearly flawless package. Halo 2 is, without a shadow of a doubt, the greatest game on the Xbox, and arguably one of the greatest games ever made.|I get Goosebumps when I discuss this game, honestly.  The genuine care that has been taken in making this game is awe inspiring.|It could be argued that Halo 2 multiplayer is not only leagues ahead of any other broadband enabled game, but it may even leave the single-player experience in the shadows. The options for online play are far more varied than even Ubisoft's Clancy titles, and the interface and lobby systems represent everything that Xbox Live is truly capable of. [XBM]|You'll be surprised and stunned by some of the turns that not only imbue the story with great depth and meaning, but indelibly impact the actual game you're playing... Halo 2 is the single greatest achievement on the platform. [Dec 2004, p.44]|For the first time ever, I was actually dumbfounded when I found myself standing on a large wasteland area, surrounded by rocks and rolling hills. I was actually intimidated by the dusky skies over head, and the burning cityscapes in the background, and how miniscule you feel really makes you realize just how great of a world Bungie has created.|The graphics in this game are mind numbing! The use of normal mapping along with bump mapping really makes it shine.|Every single aspect of the whole package that is Halo 2 seems to have been considered, reconsidered, improved and then looked at from a new perspective to see if it can be made better...It really is a case of running out of superlatives when it comes to describing Halo 2.|A fantastic example of pure artistic vision coupled with serious technological know-how.|One of the strongest FPS offerings of the season in campaign mode, and one of the best internet-enabled FPS games for any platform.|One of the best console first-person shooters ever made, with multiplayer that is way ahead of anything else on any console.|It's short single player campaign and under developed story will no doubt disappoint fans yet the games excellent multiplayer support and replay value more then make up for it ensuring the game will sit near the top of classic first person shooters.|A gripping and epic single-player game that'll take you by surprise - and perhaps the finest multiplayer game ever devised. Evolutionary rather then revolutionary, perhaps, but any way you cut it this is a first-person tour-de-force.|Worth the hype it received? Well, it definitely is worth it for the multiplayer, for the augmented gameplay features and for the vocal delivery by the Hollywood talent in the title. It isn't, however, thanks to the weakly developed storyline, similarity to the original title and the long duration that we'll have to wait through for the continuation of the saga.|The functionality of Halo 2 online is unequaled and there is something here for everyone. Before you even step into a Live arena, the amount of configuration options, both cosmetic and mechanic are almost overwhelming.|Halo 2 met my own lofty expectations in virtually every way possible, minus two small exceptions: first, I would love to have been able to play two-player co-op on Xbox Live; it's unfortunate that this didn't happen. Secondly, while I found the story much more engaging this time around, I also found the ending a little bit jarring.|The sensation is difficult to explain, but it's akin to abandoning the sensation of control itself, as if you're truly within the gameworld and every neuron twitch in your brain results in precisely the correct physical translation.|Perhaps not as groundbreaking as we were led to believe or even hoped for prior to release but an immense and masterful game all the same, as they say if it's not broken don't fix it!|It isn't a game that truly pushes the envelope, but it is one of the best shooters we've played in years, and it's one of the most solid multiplayer packages ever released.|It's a game that deserves every superlative attached to it, a title so well-rounded and technically superior that it demands to be played. [Offline review only - includes multiplayer]|While the story is an improvement on the first, the fact that the sequel is so much better means the story should have been great too.|A surprisingly disappointing story and a fairly short single-player portion are noticeable shortcomings, but there's just so much breadth of content in Halo 2, and the action itself is so outstanding, that there can be no denying its quality.|The gameplay of Halo 2 is fun, furious, and on a much bigger/grander scale than the first that really immerses players in a full scale interplanetary war. [Collector's Edition]|The game is fantastic, minus that damn draw distance problem. How could they let such a small problem like that surface up? Things can look really good, but the texture swapping can be devastating.|The A.I. is amazing this time around. It was good in Halo; it is great in Halo 2.|As a multiplayer experience, however, Halo 2 is simply unparalleled. No other game provides the sheer amount of variety, both in terms of game types and opponents, as Halo 2 currently offers.|Controls are extremely tight and responsive. You are in complete control of Master Chief's movements, so any loss or mistake is completely your own.|Optimatch is annoying many online gamers; the Flood is annoying many offline players and lowers the replayability factor, and the storyline has gone in a completely different direction to where everybody assumed it would go.|You name it, Halo 2 does it at an A+ level: wonderfully improved visuals, a solidly engaging and well-scripted storyline (with an unexpected sense of humor intermixed with the strong religious overtones), good voice-acting, splendidly ear-pleasing orchestral music, and the coup de grace, exciting online play.|It's certainly not the game to convert anyone from one camp to the other. It delivers a new story, new features and kick-ass multiplayer functionality, but still has exactly the same gameplay as we've all seen before.|The system works well, even if it is different from what you are used to. Stop whining, learn how to create a party for custom games and enjoy the benefits of the matchmaking system the rest of the time. It's not perfect but neither is the traditional server list model.|It's technically accomplished, wonderfully diverse and ridiculously fun. It's the sort of game that you want to quit work or dump the girlfriend to play.|Halo 2 is an amazing game. The negatives are by far overshadowed by the positives.|Despite a genuinely better plot this time around, the short, linear campaign and unresolved ending will certainly aggravate those hoping for a more evolved single-player game. But make no mistake – what Halo 2 lacks in its single-player it more than makes up for in its great gameplay, gorgeous delivery and flat-out addictive multiplayer.|The problem is that the ending feels more like a mission briefing than a conclusion. Secrets are revealed, the final battle is set, the music swells and then bam, credits.|It's fitting that we're able to steal a line from the script to sum everything up. No spoilers here, just an epitaph, from the moment Cortana turns to Master Chief and says this: ""It's not a new plan. But we know it'll work."" [Christmas 2004, p.74]|The truth is, for every hour our blood was pumping like a turbo charged locomotive through our adrenaline scored veins, there were an equal number of hours where we were bored with the unimaginative repetition of formulaic corridor based FPS trawls. [Single-Player review; Multiplayer also rated 90]|Bungie has managed to whittle away many of the elements we felt uncomfortable with in the original game (specifically some dull level design and unappealing multiplayer), as well as adding enough polish to make Halo 2's gameplay shine... As a sequel that's good enough to convert even those who didn't enjoy the original title, we doubt anyone could have asked for anything more. [Christmas 2004, p.122]|The end still lands with a blindsiding jolt. It doesn't help that the last moments of gameplay are so anticlimactic. Regardless of the game's end and its other problems, it takes a fool to say that Halo 2 is a bad game.|It begins at a frantic pace and those early stages are particularly brilliant, however it's over all too soon and the cliffhanger climax is likely to infuriate as many as those who begin counting down the days until ""Halo 3.""|Marty O'Donnell has done an incredible job with the game's audio, and it may stand alongside the multiplayer component as the game's best achievement.|It's a great game that will be a disappointment to some people due to the length of the single player experience but multiplayer easily makes up for any shortcomings the campaign may have.|A significant step forward from the original but hardly revolutionizes the genre or even the series. The game starts off playing and looking like the original and slowly evolves into something slightly new and improved.|Graphics are about as good as they're likely to get on the Xbox... But close-ups, particularly textures in some of the outdoor environments, are jarringly ugly when juxtaposed with the many areas of sheer beauty.|The problem is that these improvements come across more as refinements than groundbreaking changes since they do not dramatically alter the overall game playing experience.|What Halo 2 isn't is a huge leap forward for the FPS genre, and Halo 2 suffers for it in terms of it's longevity. Run, gun, hide, run, gun and hide again; this isn't a cerebral shooter -but then again, it was never meant to be. We were wishing for more than we ended up with, however. [Single-Player review]|The game is shorter than the original title, and if you play games to get a great ending, Halo 2 is not going to give it to you. The ending made our jaws drop, but not in a positive sense.|A fun, fast paced shooter with lots of multiplayer action. It is not, however, the be all and end all of gaming that the hype machine has unfailingly claimed.|No single level in Halo 2 is as good as The Silent Cartographer (though the second level does come close), and there are moments that are just as repetitive and lazy as The Library.|In spite of a weak ending that is little more than a setup for ""Halo 3,"" the game is a satisfying experience. It is tremendous fun to jump on an enemy vehicle, punch the driver until he falls out, get in and start blasting.|Bungie have succeeded in creating a world of characters that are impossible to care about. It turns from ""Star Wars"" into ""Battlefield Earth"" far too quickly, and even John Travolta would pass up on this one...The dominating storyline robs from what should have been a fantastic title, the atmosphere gets bogged down with drawn out cutscenes and then ultimately peters out. [Offline review only - includes multiplayer]|The single-player campaign is boring and ineffective, the action is dull, the level structure is bland and the overall game lacks the oomph and power of the original. HALO 2's multiplayer aspect fares a little better but it's marred by an ineffective matchmaking service and some poor judgment in the balance department.|Awfully flat and mediocre. The plot is labyrinthine, missions run on rails through an endless stream of lookalike corridors, action is strictly of the repetitive shoot-everything-that-moves school of design, and the art department at Bungie clearly should have tried coloring with more than one or two of the crayons in the box.|I felt so screwed out of some sort of satisfaction, screwed out of more levels off of the Halo, screwed out of many hours of my life that I just poured into one of the most amazingly bad excuses for a single-player first-person shooter campaign. I was bored, I was tired and by the end of it, I was just really pissed off."

The action and suspense will be with you at all times.|An amazing achievement in a variety of ways, especially in how its inspired, state-of-the-art cinematic presentation works so well with its relentlessly exciting, white-knuckle action, all of which is wrapped up in a decidedly lengthy adventure chock-full of hidden secrets and bonus extras.|This reinventing of the wheel, so to speak, results in a fresher, more fast paced, and most of all more rewarding experience all around.

It is apparent to me that this was a project that was loved from the moment it was dreamt up and that sense of caring simply shines through like a beacon in the darkness.|The visuals found in RE4 are stunning. Excellent character modeling and animation make the world come alive, while detailed level design and texture mapping set the stage.|Some people may have minor issues with the control and camera aspects, but once you get past the first hour or so they'll find yourself being sucked in a game which is so consistently excellent that it's suitable to call it a masterpiece.

And it just feels so affirming to play a game this confident, this well-crafted, this, well, fun.|The fact it is an excellent action horror game is secondary to the fact that it's simply a brilliant game.

It is actually scary and that is no small feat for a video game. [Mar. 05]|Capcom's reinvented the wheel in high style, and while they've traded in their usual attempts at horror in favor of intensely creepy action, the game's better for it.|Not since ""Silent Hill 3"" and ""Eternal Darkness"" has a survival horror game offered so much polish and fascination.|The combat gameplay is unrivaled, especially during some of the very creative boss battles.

[March 2005, p.92]|Part of Resident Evil 4's charm comes in recognising the various sources that have inspired Mikami throughout the development cycle. The initial stages of the game owe much to Tobe Hooper's horror classic ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre,"" with the run-down houses and crazed psychotic villagers.|I hate survival horror games. I've found them to be tedious and unnerving. However, there's something about Resident Evil 4 that draws me back again and again. Maybe it's the action-packed gameplay, the execution of the story, or even the wonderfully vivid presentation. Whatever it is, this game is something special.|The creepy atmosphere remains, but puzzles, alas, are few and far between, and so easy that they function only as lulls in the action. Yet the game is so riveting that this is forgivable.|It has freaky monsters that pull out new surprises just when you think you're used to them. It has interesting boss battles. It has vile villains you really want to smack down. It has desperate battles where you're trapped in flimsy shacks while psychotic villagers break through doors and windows.|The game for the first time ever actually has a counterpoint to these [hopeless] moments; the ying to that helpless-and-hopeless yang. That ying is an exhilarating sense of heroic empowerment.|If RE4 has any problem, it goes on a little too long (it spans two discs), with one boss battle and plot twist too many. However, there's an extensive reward system, including unlockable content that adds excellent replay value.|By ditching tired and overdone conventions and replacing them with a new theme and a more action-heavy style, Capcom has created a half-familiar, half-original masterpiece of atmosphere and menace.|While RE4 has a spectacular opening, the game's plot is at times as boring as a shambling zombie, and while the developers did a marvelous job with the game's graphics, its memorable boss battles, and some of the gameplay mechanics, the emphasis on action somewhat demeans the overall experience, leaving me to conclude that while Resident Evil 4 is one of the greatest games ever made it's by no means a perfect one.|As good as it is though, it isn't perfect, which shows that the whole concept of a wholly linear 3rd person ""horror"" shooter wasn't all that great to begin with. I put horror in quotes because the game never actually scared me once, but if you're a squeamish pre-teen who can't watch Jurassic Park without wetting the bed this might not be an experience you'll enjoy.|"

At a budget price, you'd be crazy not let own this gem.|If it were simply the original Ninja Gaiden with just some mission modes tacked on, it would still be worth full price. But chiming in at around $30 with new missions, new difficulty settings, new cinemas and new costumes to unlock -- on top of the already-awesome, original game -- it's practically a steal. Uncompromising and unabridged, Ninja Gaiden Black shows you how reissues could and should be done.|For the price you simply will not find a better deal this year. Even if you beat the first game to death including both Hurricane Packs, NGB is still worth owning.|The new content alone more than makes it a worthy purchase even for those who have played the original release. A year on, Ninja Gaiden is still an extraordinary game. Game of the Year? Insulting. Game of the Generation.|While most of Ninja Gaiden: Black is the same as before, the little additions that have been added make a world of difference, especially for those hardcore gamers looking for more punishment. And if all that content isn't enough, you even get the old school arcade Ninja Gaiden, too.|It's amazing that Team Ninja was actually able to take one of the best games ever to hit the Xbox (or any console) and make it better in nearly every way.|Everything the original was but better. In fact, Ninja Gaiden Black proves to be one of the best action titles of this generation.|It will go down in gaming history as a classic that defined its generation.|It's not very often I can recommend a game with virtually no reservation, but Ninja Gaiden Black is one of those few titles that everyone with an Xbox should at least play and probably own.|This is probably the best thirty bucks you'll spend on a game this year in terms of bang for your gaming buck.|Ninja Gaiden Black may very well be the pinnacle of video gaming this generation.|The quick reaction time that Ryu has when you press a button is simply amazing and truly feels like you are playing with a ninja.|Fifty segment Mission Mode, four difficulties, and a complete arcade ROM equal marathon game sessions in Ninja Gaiden BLACK.|One of the greatest action games in recent memory. Upon further examination, it may be one of the best of all time.|Even if you already have a copy of the original game in your library, Black is an absolute necessity. [Oct 2005, p.140]|It is arguably without peer, the ultimate game for the audience open to its madness. [Oct 2005, p.56]|This has to be one of the slickest, brutal, most breath taking games I have ever played! Frustration factor can be high when you start the game, but once you stop button mashing and start using the combo system as it was meant to be the game becomes very rewarding.|On the enemies, you can see individual scales shining perfectly in each light source, see through their translucent wings, and be dazzled by their massive energy attacks.|I don't think I can possibly convey how much of an adrenaline pumping experience the new Mission Mode is with mere words. It has to be experienced. The missions are unadulterated action and if that's all there were to the game, I'd still recommend it.|But this new installment seems bent on achieving nothing less than perfection by using last year's game as a starting point and fine-tuning its few issues, while also adding lots of new options and content, such as a lengthy series of stand-alone missions that emphasize the game's unbelievably intense, brutal, lighting-fast combat.|Prepare to be challenged like you've never been challenged before to complete an action-adventure game. If you make it through Ninja Gaiden Black, be proud, because it definitely is one of the hardest games to complete that you'll ever play.|Black does what the original did best, and hits the elevator button and ascends to an even higher level. [Nov 2005, p.134]|No one ever said that being a ninja was easy, but I can tell you for certain that being a ninja has never been this much fun. Don't wait, get your mitts on this game immediately.|If we were stuck on a desert island with a TV, an Xbox and a generator, Ninja Gaiden Black is the only game we'd need. It really is that good! [Official UK XBox Magazine]|Just beware that you have to run through the game to unlock the new mission modes, but if you're a big fan, you will probably welcome the idea.|An incredible game, but there are other, cheaper options that are available to cash-strapped gamers.|The action is superb, with silky smooth combos, lots of movement options, and intuitive control. The graphics are still tops on the market. The quest is fulfilling and varied.|It's also a lot more difficult than its predecessor, so if you didn't feel challenged enough by the prequel, this version promises to bludgeon the hell out of you.|Making Ninja Gaiden harder is like ordering waffles fixed with broken glass, with a helping of broken glass on the side. It's downright tasty at times, but you better have a taste for it before scarfing it down.|Kudos to Tecmo and Team Ninja for adding some great enhancements to an already great game. We just wish they would have released it like this in the first place.|The most notable addition over the first outing is the aforementioned Mission Mode, though since it does not become available until completing the game once, many players are likely to throw in the towl long before even seeing this new content. Some might call it a feature, but it seems more like punishment.|On the technical side of things, Ninja Gaiden Black has a problem that wasn't present in the original release. The game is prone to bouts of slowdown at impromptu moments and these aren't particularly hectic instances either.|"

That's right, you and a buddy can now join up to take down enemies and pull off a variety of acrobatic moves, and it may very well be the most satisfying experience I've ever had on Live.|Visually spectacular and hugely rewarding.|Sam Fisher, the western equivalent of Solid Snake, shines brightly in his third game as did his Japanese counterpart in his third game. As a whole, Chaos Theory is by far the best instalment in the Splinter Cell -series. The game does more than just recycle old ideas. [May 2005, p.60]|Without a doubt the best the stealth genre can offer... One of the best games I have ever played.|UbiSoft is going to be hard pressed to beat it.|Three brilliant games rolled into one that could all easily be sold separately. The single player is incredibly satisfying, co-op is one of a kind and adds a fresh and very compelling face to the underused online co-op genre and the adversarial mode is simply brilliant once again; an online experience no person with high speed internet should miss.|By far the best game that the series has produced.|Ultimately, Chaos Theory leaves the player stunned, excited and thoroughly satisfied. A landmark achievement in stealth gaming. [Xbox World]|I can't say enough about the graphics. I never knew there were so many shades of black. Even though much of the game is played in the shadows there is no shortage of detail.|Ubisoft's obvious dedication and purity of vision shines through in every single minute that you're playing. It never seems to get old, it's rarely frustrating, and delivers its payload of stealth, action, strategy and exploration right on target. If there's a more complete gaming experience on Xbox, I've yet to see it.|Ubi has improved virtually every aspect of the gameplay from the previous two versions, and introduced even more new options and gameplay types. With the solo campaign, co-op campaign and online multiplayer, it's almost like having three games in one.|Between the compelling gameplay of the single-player missions, the value of the versus mode, and the perfect integration of co-op play over Live, this is the definitive Xbox game. The zenith of the platform... An utterly spectacular accomplishment. [Apr 2005, p.72]|The multiplayer in Chaos Theory is incredibly addictive.|A blockbuster. If you don't buy this game you don't deserve to own an Xbox; it's that good. Everything about this game is top-notch, from the gameplay, to the graphics, to the sound; it's all tremendously well done.|The formula has been tweaked to an almost perfect mix of story and engrossing gameplay that still requires more use of brain over brawn... The presentation is off the charts with mesmerizing visuals and audio production, both of which have a major impact on how you play.|Writing in video games is a subject that doesn't get a lot of attention, but Chaos Theory features a simply great script. Not only is it complex and deep, it's also surprisingly funny. [Apr 2005, p.112]|Making a return appearance is the very innovative Spies vs. Mercenaries multiplayer with its own set of improvements including a very cool active camouflage for the spies that makes them practically invisible.|With a slick story, great visuals, awesome multiplayer possibilities, and a style that is unmatched, Chaos Theory does not disappoint.|Nearly a flawless gameplay experience.|After my first week of playing, I must freely admit that one of my biggest thrills in SP mode is taking out a guard and finding a high spot from which to drop him.

[May 2005, p.44]|It's simply brilliant. The modes, graphics, gameplay, sound, music, acting, dialogue, and every other little piece in between all come together to create a tense, sweaty-palm experience you can't find anywhere else. [Apr 2005, p.126]|You can't be a serious game player and not have this game.  It's simply a must buy.  It is the perfect third in a near perfect game series.|The only real gripe against the game is that the control isn't as intuitive as it can be. There are many options in a given situation, and the game still relies on the same context-sensitive menu system, which is a bit cumbersome.|The best stealth game ever, period.|I am truly amazed at how this game can interest nearly all types of gamers with the ability to play Chaos Theory either by stealth or action.|This gameplay variation is a fantastic move on Ubisoft's part, because it makes Chaos Theory more accessible to a wider audience while still supporting a more slow-paced game.|Chaos Theory takes the best aspects of the previous games and makes them shine even more.

But if it's your first entry in the series, then you'll be enthralled.|On the basis of single-player alone, Chaos Theory earns a high recommendation.

This time it is smoother and even more playable than before, but the story is still virtually non-existent. The co-op mode is a great addition, it just needs more missions.

If you like your games hard and your competition brutal, don't let Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory out of your sight.|The combination of cutting-edge technology and consuming game design creates an experience that is hard to put down, and it's really only minor gripes that prevent this from being a perfect score.|The game feels real enough that you might want to sneak up on a cop on a late Saturday night after playing for a few hours.|It's not too often when a series can challenge me to think of the endless possibilities for future installments all because of a sound formula established by its flawed first installment.|Gorgeously lit levels create some amazingly atmospheric - and realistic - shadows to lurk in. The cod liver oil's been doing the trick too, as Sam's slinky, cat-like movements are animated in a stunningly believable way. [Official UK Xbox Magazine]|The single-player is short but sweet, and the multiplayer is just totally sick.  With the addition of cooperative play and a new action-focused approach, it makes Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory the most accessible, entertaining, and enjoyable game in the series so far.|Improved in practically every way. More abilities, more weapons, more gadgets and overall just more choice. Level designs offer far more options to the player and the game is simply more fun because of it.|Whereas small refinements dominate the single-player mode, the new co-op game revolutionizes the multiplayer mode. Co-op takes on a whole new meaning in Chaos Theory as two spies must literally work together to accomplish a mission.|I wanted to give Chaos Theory a five-star rating like its brother before it, I really did. But something held me back, probably the lack of so many co-op maps or something about the way the gameplay didn't jar me like it used to, as excellent as it remains.|It's definitely an evolutionary step rather than something highly original, but even those who weren't enamored with earlier Splinter Cell titles should try out this more open-ended gameplay style.|The pinnacle of both stealth and Tom Clancy games, and is light years ahead of its peers. The changes to the gameplay structure accompanied with the very open-ended levels make for a simply brilliant single-player game.|Not only does Sam Fisher dethrone Solid Snake, he snaps his neck when he's not looking. Now that's a sign of greatness.|The only aspect of the game that the developers have neglected to improve is the enemy AI, who remain as simple as ever before and can be lead like well armed, extremely dangerous sheep to the slaughter.|Chaos Theory sometimes has a designed-by-committee feel due to its many disparate parts, and despite the game's grittier new theme and its new ""Mature"" rating, it's going to offer a familiar experience to Splinter Cell veterans. But even if some of the changes are marginal, this is still the most entertaining, most well-rounded game in the series yet.|Perhaps Sam is just getting older, perfecting his skills while losing some feistiness. His games are following the same path, with increasingly sophisticated, deep gameplay but a little less flair.|Chaos Theory is the game that the original Splinter Cell was meant to deliver: a tight play experience within a trusty framework, one more of enjoyment than irritation, and a game that's no longer exclusively for fans of repeated reloading. [Apr 2005, p.97]|Despite the inclusion of new gadgets and stunning visuals, the series is starting to decompose; playing the same thing over and over is beginning to wear a little thin. It's a good job the multiplayer experience continues to blossom. [Apr 2005, p.90]|Its learning curve is fair instead of gleefully obstinate and that's what marks this series' major step forward.|I'll reserve a four-star rating for the next time this series takes big leaps. In this latest edition, there's nothing so new that you'll stop and say, ""Whoa."" But Chaos Theory is true to the things that make Splinter Cell games so good.|"

Focussing on delivering THE next-generation action blockbuster, it would be hard to describe Epic's effort as particularly creative or revolutionary; but it is a shooter of the highest quality - one to hold out on the 360 as being testament to what the system can achieve with a talented team and a $10 million budget - roll on Gears of War 2...|The campaign is over much too quickly and multiplayer isn't nearly as deep as some other games, but this isn't about playing Gears of War ten, fifteen years down the road. It's all about partaking in this mass, shared experience, one that'll no doubt keep Xbox 360s running for a long time.|Sure, Gears of War doesn't really offer much that is new to the shooter genre but in the same token provides an experience that is extremely well polished and more importantly, fun to play.|One of the Xbox 360's best moments to date. Gears of War trades off innovation for the sake of high-class production, solid gameplay and enjoyable combat. A must.|Visually the game is stunning. You really need a HDTV to see this game the way it should be played but even at the lower resolution its better than anything on the console so far.|If only more multiplayer modes had been created, Gears of War would be regarded as the perfect Xbox Live game.|Gorgeous visuals, fantastic gameplay, and just one of the most entertaining shooters of a long time.|Appropriately billed by some as a third-person tactical action/horror shooter it is frighteningly good. Although what's really scary is to think what things will look like with a few more years' development time and the know-how to push the hardware even further.|Gears of War does exactly what it promised to do – have jaw dropping visuals, strong presentation, fluid gameplay, and integrated multiplayer (co-op at any time). Perhaps we're not justified in asking any more than that and to tell the truth all else is forgotten as soon as you get thrown into the game.|The elements of the story are certainly nothing inspiring but chuck in simply awesome graphics, cool dynamics and a cracking good time to be had while killing the bad guys, you've got a game that is a total blast and more fun than is feasibly possible.|The Xbox 360 finally has the format-exclusive AAA title it's been hankering after since day one.|Gears of War satisfies that deep yearning for a vigorous, bloody, and action-packed shooter on Xbox 360, and it does so with style. Epic's team has handled nearly everything (except the story, really) with great craft, technical genius, and completeness.|Gears of War shows that intelligent game designers can use high-powered consoles for more than just making prettier versions of existing games.|Another negative  aspect that many seem to overlook is that Gears of War doesn't sway very far from traditional action/shooter standards; there's not a whole of innovation here.|Gears of War has graphics to die for, but very little else. The singleplayer storyline utterly failed to hold my interest. Even worse, the main gameplay mechanic repeats itself to death – you just sit still behind a cover and shoot it out. On the plus side, the co-op and the multiplayer modes are fun. [Dec 2006]|It refines and codifies the advances that prior titles have made before it and packages all these lessons in what are undeniably sumptuous visuals.|It really will take you only around six hours to complete the Campaign on the standard setting, but you will have such an exhilarating time playing through it you will probably start all over again on Insane difficulty...However, Gears longevity is sure to be guaranteed by its multiplayer modes that we predict could be the game to finally topple ""Halo 2"" from the top of the Xbox Live 'most played' stats.|If you want to gorge on a next generation audio-visual feast then Gears of Wars is a king's banquet. But what of the gameplay pudding that Peter Moore so often reminds us that he likes? The proof, he says, is in the eating, and in this case Gears of War sticks to a well-worn recipe.|But for all the excellence on show, there's no shaking the sense that this is a game that does everything that was asked of it, but nothing more. [Christmas 2006, p.72]|Call me a jaded critic, a wet blanket, or anything else, but I'm not going to be dazzled into submission by stunning visuals and overlook a core game design that doesn't impress.|"

Everything is bright and wonderful in the sunshine, birds singing, pigeons flocking, butterflies dodging about in the shadows, and then environments look damp, cold and miserable when rain rolls into town. The level of detail is quite breathtaking.|For those used to linear, Japanese-style role-playing games, Oblivion will seem like a revelation. All the games in this series have been known for their sheer vastness and freedom of choice, but the Elder Scrolls IV takes that concept and runs with it.|It’s just so damned big. That’s what you’ll say after playing Oblivion for more than an hour. Or, for that matter, 50 hours.|Oblivion is a blast to play, and it's a considerable achievement in the annals of electronic role-playing games.|One of the ultimate RPG’s of our lifetime. It is an experience you won’t soon forget and possibly one that might never end.|Like Homer, once you've begun to consume what this eternity has to offer, you'll have no desire to stop. The fourth Elder Scrolls entry is utterly brilliant and should not be missed by any adventure-spirited gamer.|The painstaking attention to detail, outstanding worldcrafting, and inspired AI make it a huge improvement; and there wasn't all that much wrong with ""Morrowind"" to begin with. Oblivion is a stunning game -- don't miss it.|A staggeringly ambitious game that successfully unites some of the best elements of RPG, adventure and action games and fuses them into a relentlessly immersive and intoxicating whole.|Oblivion not only raises the bar in the visual and audio modules but also in the gameplay and presentation department, making it easily one of the most recommendable titles to anyone who has ever enjoyed the thought of truly doing whatever they want in a video game, in a world where actions actually mean something.|It is quite possible to blow through the game in 30 hours, but it is equally possible to play for 400 and still not have done everything there is to do in Cyrodiil.|The graphics are nothing short of incredible.

Whether it’s the fantastic production values or its nearly flawless gameplay mechanics, we couldn’t be happier with Oblivion.|Its gameplay, graphics, and auditory value are all off the chain. In addition, its replayability will provide hundreds of hours of wholesome fun. My only personal complaint is this: due to the immense worlds, obscene amounts of terrain, and overall hugeness of this software, I found myself becoming nauseated and oftentimes lightheaded and dizzy. You’ve been warned.|Oblivion took our expectations for the game and sent them ... well ... into oblivion.|""Morrowind"" earned recognition for being one of the best role-playing games in years, but the immersive and long-lasting experience it provided wasn't for everyone.

Though the voices occasionally repeat, it's pretty impressive that they managed to cram so much voiced dialogue in here, and most of it is high-quality work.|The game will provide you with more content than you can possibly handle, and is one of the few games on the market today that’s actually worth the full $60 price tag.|What really makes it different is the level of immersion that is offered.

Outside of the orchestral score Bethesda Softworks went all out with the voice over talent bringing Patrick Stewart, Sean Bean, and Terrance Stamp to give voices to their characters.|Oblivion is a game that defines freedom within a videogame, one that accepts whatever role players choose and allowing them to play the game as they see fit; for this reason alone, Oblivion is a game with very few rivals - a flawed masterpiece.|Oblivion is easily the finest open-ended RPG to date. It lacks the out-of-the-box crippling technical issues of every other Elder Scrolls game, looks great, and delivers on every promise Bethesda made during its development.|Next generation graphics, huge improvements on all fronts from its predecessors, a 40 hour main storyline, and 100s of hours of side quests make this an RPG gamer’s dream come true.|Go ahead, look up the word 'Epic' in a dictionary; you should come across the following entry - 'Surpassing the usual or ordinary, particularly in scope or size'.

It'll consume your life, your performance at work will suffer and you might not see friends in weeks.

[Issue#5, p.76]|Bethesda fulfills the hopes of fans with this truly epic RPG, laced with genuinely jaw-dropping next-gen visuals and the customary deep and satisfying gameplay.|Rise of Legends does evolve the series and the genre.

Oblivion is without question a strong contender for the best game of 2006.|Bethesda's ""Morrowind"" is a great videogame, but its successor, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, does exactly what every sequel should do, which is taking its predecessor, beat the hell out of it, and leave it for dead. This absolutely marvelous videogame is not only the premier visual show piece for the Xbox 360 hardware, but it's also tremendously enjoyable to play.|Oblivion's more than just a game -- it's an entire world for the taking, the only single-player RPG that could possibly give a game like ""World of Warcraft"" a real run for its money.|It's got plenty to recommend it, but apart from its unprecedented visual achievements this is not a life-changing, essential or fully ""next-gen"" experience. It's a good, solid RPG that doesn't break the mold but instead makes one that's bigger and shinier.|There are sections of the game where you hit invisible walls -- presumably to make way for more expansion packs, although at the time of writing the only expansion available for Xbox 360 owners is some rather expensive downloadable horse armor -- and some wacky bugs that'll sometimes see you floating on air when you dismount a horse.|It’s debatable whether Oblivion is a great adventure, but it’s certainly one of the broadest around and one that’s a willing canvas for a variety of approaches from its players.

So far, this is the best game of 2007.|By far and away the very pinnacle of first-person shooters, with 2K achieving those heady heights by braving to not just push against established genre barriers and expectations but to rip them out and place BioShock atop the pile as a landmark pseudo-RPG first-person shooter that will be a benchmark of quality for many years to come. Staggering.|Bioshock has got everything that a great triple-A title needs, and it’s got it in spades. Intense combat, amazing and deep story, beautiful graphics, awesome sound – yes please. Add to that the level of customization and the multiple endings, and you’ve got something worth talking about.|Without doubt, BioShock is truly a next-gen masterpiece, more than worthy of your attention. It simply blows everything comparable out of the water and for now we challenge you to find otherwise.|Bioshock is one of those rare games that completely sucks you into its world.|A modern day gaming masterpiece. Simply put, it's one of the greatest games of the current era and serves as a high watermark that may not be surpassed for years to come. From the compelling plot and completely convincing atmosphere to the fantastic graphics and attention to detail, Bioshock is the total package.|There is art here, despite what many would say isn't possible with games, from Roger Ebert to game designers like Hideo Kojima...BioShock stands as a monolithic example of the convergence of entertaining gameplay and an irresistibly sinister, engrossing storyline that encompasses a host of multifaceted characters. This is an essential gaming experience.|Don’t miss this masterful shooter.|Some of Bioshock's storytelling techniques are unprecedented and will perhaps set a new standard for storytelling excellence in gaming. It doesn't hurt that Bioshock's great story is framed by incredible visuals and solid controls as well.|I cannot say enough good about Bioshock so I will sum it all up in the same way I described the experience to my wife, ""This is why I play video games.""|With strong voice acting, a solid array of weapons and abilities at your disposal, a great score, wonderfully creepy atmosphere, beautifully detailed environments, nearly unparalleled art-design, solid game-play and an engine that runs smooth as silk, BioShock stands testament to just what the term ""next-generation"" should mean.|Graphically, Bioshock is simply a masterpiece. The graphics are equally measured by fantastic technical excellence, showing without a doubt the best water effects in any game and an art style that flows through the city of Rapture, providing a streaming masterpiece.|BioShock is one of those games that goes down in history as a shining example for other developers to learn from.|If you're looking for another run 'n gun game to play while you chug down a few Cokes, you'll probably be better off not picking BioShock up. If you want a good game you can play in the dark, immerse yourself in, and love well-crafted plots and great writing, there is absolutely no reason why you shouldn't go get BioShock tomorrow morning.|The atmosphere, the water, the story, the architecture, and the perfectly tuned challenge all come together to create one of the greatest experiences of this generation of consoles. Rapture is awaiting. Bliss is inevitable.|Engaging, immersive, repulsive, beautiful and challenging on every level, all at the same time. The bar has been raised...An experience of this calibre only comes around every few years and should be played by as many people as possible.|Bioshock delivers an outstanding adventure deep into a psychotic world filled with wonder and interesting plot developments and characters.|The atmosphere is second to none, the action frantic and fun, and the ease of access means you can play the game however you want without being punished for it.|BioShock has more cool elements than any ten other FPSs combined. I would say there is more variation in two play-throughs of BioShock than there is between most FPSs and their sequels.|The first-person shooter is, simply, one of the best games ever made. [Oct 2007, p.86]|If ever there was an example of how a first person shooter should be made, then this is truly it.|Like the game's maniacal entrepreneur himself loftily aimed, Irrational put art and intellect above and beyond schlock of the common game. They accomplished something wonderful.|BioShock is one of those rare titles where considerable attention was placed on every facet of development, resulting in an extremely polished, fun, and engaging adventure.|The graphics are amazing; the audio is possibly even more stunning; the sheer cohesiveness of the world of Rapture is absurdly impressive; the gameplay is very tight, polished, frantic, and fun; and all of these elements combine to create an experience that is even greater than the sum of its (already remarkable) parts. This is simply a game that everyone needs to play.|It is not a game that tries to shock with new exciting gameplay twists, nor does it confuse with new fangled control methods. It just takes everything most gamers have grown to love over the years, wraps them up in a beautifully realised world, and refines them to near perfection.|It's inventive and entertaining, with a number of twists and unexpected situations that'll have you on the edge of your seat...It's rare to find a game that has both quality in its engineering and quality in its gameplay.|Yes folks, we have played BioShock and we loved it. The minor flaws in the game's design didn't keep us from having an all night session to get to the end and we think that will be your conclusion as well.|Like Half-Life 2 before it, BioShock is a breath of fresh air in a genre that has been saturated with the same old settings, the same old abilities, and the same old lame storylines that mostly serve as just a reason to shoot things up.|Bioshock leaves you to figure things out for yourself. It's a gruelling game of resource management, and as the ammunition dries up, you end up having to improvise. And more often than not, Bioshock will reward you heavily for thinking outside the box.|Overall, the game has a solid atmosphere, which entirely suits the vintage 50’s style décor which is in every aspect of this wonderful game.|It meshes impressive graphics with an inventive gameplay system, and uses them to push an amazing story in a refreshingly unique setting. Unless you faint at the sight of blood or you absolutely despise FPS games, you should consider this game a must buy.|Without a doubt, BioShock is a shoe-in for hordes of Game of the Year nominations. It’s certainly among my favorite titles of the year, and I highly recommend it to all gamers, whether you’ve got an Xbox 360 or a gaming PC. If you haven’t played it yet, then I suggest you at least go out and give the demo a try.|In a nutshell, beyond any shadow of doubt, BioShock is an excellent single-player shooter experience. The undeniable quality of this title and its emphasis on true and not pseudo-mature storytelling and character development make it a must-have for every self-respecting gamer.|If Bioshock has one notable flaw, it lies in the game's difficulty level, or lack thereof. On the normal difficulty level, it's just a bit too easy. It is still fun, but once you start getting a solid number of plasmids, you can tear through every Splicer in your way as if they were nothing.|While BioShock has an intriguing back story, the game’s episodic, mission-based structure lacks the propulsive momentum of games like ""Half-Life"" or ""Max Payne."" The story is better than that of many action games, but BioShock’s gameplay and visuals are so utterly brilliant that it is a shame it fails to reach the same level of greatness in its storytelling.|BioShock feels too long, even though it's actually not. This is the result of your being given too many item-collection goals, which will often mean backtracking for those who've been diligent explorers. [Oct 2007, p.64]|The story, the huge decaying city, the personalities of the people you see, hear, and listen to...all of it combines together to create a masterpiece of gaming.|BioShock gets everything right with the storyline and the setting. Rapture is a seriously creepy place to be in. While the combat differs from a standard first person shooter, Bioshock's extra tricks do not require much creative thinking. The same routine of hacking everything in sight to bits and setting oil slicks on fire just keeps on repeating over and over again. A pity, really. [Sept 2007]|BioShock is one of the best games of 2007 for any platform, not so much because it offers new wonders - there are a few - but as a result of meeting high standards, as any diamond should.|Its weak link is its unsatisfying no-skill-required combat, which might aim this one just over the head of the average Halo fan. But if you want to get a little fancy, there's a lot of fun to be had with some of the game's more indirect fighting methods. It builds an amazing atmosphere by using terrific graphics and sound to set a creepy mood. But BioShock's real strengths are as a compelling work of interactive fiction, and as a unique ride through a warped world with some great payoff built into its mysterious plot. If that description has you even the least bit interested, you won't be disappointed one bit.|Games don’t get much better than this and if you are into shooting adventuring and general gaming then Bioshock is well worthy of a purchase.|You owe it to yourself to experience BioShock, by far one of the most compelling games of 2007.|Trying to usurp ""System Shock II"" in the scary stakes is no easy feat, and whilst Bioshock doesn't quite manage to replicate the fear I remember in 1999, it does have its moments. Plenty of times I found myself eager to progress, but at the same time, terrified to take a step further in fear of what lay ahead.|BioShock's combination of a compelling story, increased interactivity and fantastic gameplay raises the bar for all future first person shooters.|Flawed though it may be, it's one of the most atmospheric first-person games ever made and perhaps the standout title of the generation so far. Dazzling, thought provoking, compelling and engaging, it's an experience which refuses to lessen its hold until you've seen it through to the end, and in doing so, lodges itself in the memory in a way that few other titles can.|Rapture is a beautifully stylised city that provides plenty of mystery and intrigue. Definitely a game of the year contender.|Bioshock is a real triumph, a wonderful story told in a beautiful world gone terribly wrong. Xbox 360 owners may balk at a game that doesn't feature multiplayer action but this really shouldn't put you off.|Bioshock does something that video games rarely bother to do: Break new ground. A combination of endlessly creative combat, mixed with a captivating story make for an experience that I can promise you've never had in any other video game before.|BioShock has a surprisingly deep and vivid storyline. It doesn't just throw you a few curveballs; it refines how stories are told in gaming. [Nov 2007, p.50]|If only the mechanics matched the atmosphere. If only Rapture was a less linear world to move through. If only BioShock was the wholly brilliant experience you know, from your moments within it, it could have been.[Oct 2007, p.88]|"

Of course, the multiplayer is every bit as astonishing as it has been in past iterations and even eclipses its predecessors in many respects.|The best game yet in one of the best FPS franchises of the era. Better than either of its predecessors, Halo 3 still can't quite escape the category of flawed masterpiece - but this time around, the flaws are so minor that even the most churlish of reviewers would be hard pressed to mark the game down.|The single player is bigger and brawnier than anything that's been attempted on a console before. The multiplayer, which already shadowed the competition, has improved to the point of ridiculousness. The new features - Forge, Saved Films, Coop - are frighteningly addictive. And if you don't like any of that, you're always welcome to edit it until you do.|It's hard to imagine a feature of this game that someone won't love...

Just as ""Lord of the Rings: Return of the King"" and ""Spiderman 3"" brought to a close two of the most lucrative and epic film trilogies of all time, Halo 3 brings to a close perhaps the most complete, engaging and downright fun video game trilogy of all time. There is absolutely no way any Halo fan will be disappointed by this game.|It's well-tested, well-honed, and polished--all qualities you'd expect from Bungie, but the developer's talented and hard-working team shouldn't be taken for granted. Halo 3 may look OK and play similarly, but it will stand in the top echelon of Xbox 360 games for years.|The maps are all well-designed, the equipment adds strategic elements to matches, and the creative powers granted to players are unrivaled, at least for a console game.

Has Bungie delivered on the hype? I most certainly think so.|Halo was remarkable in the ambition and innovation that made it so fresh, but the mighty number three doesn't have quite that same freshness - instead, it has a reassuring maturity to it, crafted as it is by a team who have learned from every mistake they've made and every word of feedback the community has offered over the years. Halo 3 is the best Halo has ever been, and you won't find a greater accolade than that.|Bungie was able to utilize the 360's hardware to provide not only a visual stunning masterpiece, but a great sounding one too.|Halo 3 gives a deeper, smoother and grander ride then ever before.|If I had to describe this game in one word, it would be ""solid"" – the weapons feel just right, the sounds represent impact perfectly, and the sound effects themselves are entirely suitable.|The conventional multiplay aspects would have left most reviewers a sweaty mess on their carpets, but Bungie's innovations have pushed the boundaries on not only what multiplay does, but what multiplayer is.

It looks better, and plays about the same, but it doesn't take many chances-the ""forge"" system and the new custom games are excluded from matchmaking, and the neat theater option isn't really an upgrade to the gameplay. But still, we applaud you, for in giving us more of the same, you have given us exactly what we wanted.|Despite Halo 3's overall greatness, we can't help but feel somewhat let down by the narrative's lackluster conclusion (but stay tuned after the credits roll for a coda that hits just the right note).|The game's end sequence, to put it mildly, is an eight-car pileup. Fans of the series will recognize it as a poorly veiled swipe of a sequence in the original Halo, a challenge highlighted by a series of goofy circumstances and improbable level design meant to create an explosive end. The end result, however, is fairly absurd, as the whole shebang reeks of game developers wracking their brains to come up with the cleverest, most exciting finish, and shattering the fourth wall in the process.|The Forge and Theatre modes redefine what it is to make a game ""for the fans"", as they are substantial and influential additions to the game and have the potential to build Halo 3 even further then it has ever been before.|A few niggling flaws — or maybe just impossibly high expectations — keep Halo 3 from perfection. But on the whole, it’s a heartfelt and worthy conclusion to one of the most beloved video game series of all time.|Bungie has delivered an excellent Campaign mode, arguably the best multi-player experience on any platform and almost endless replay value. But Halo 3 scores most highly for artistic vision, capitalising on all of the series' greatest visual motifs.|Naturally, the game is highly detailed, and the transition to the current console generation has certainly been successful. But you can’t help but notice the amount of aliasing, and it really doesn’t suit Halo 3 in any way.|The campaign by itself offers a painfully mediocre experience. Halo 3 really shines in its multiplayer aspects, both Co-Op and competitive. Co-Op alters the campaign experience enough to marginalize the vast majority of its problems and bring you back time and again to play through with friends.|It’s the Halo sequel that fans have been demanding. And it’s the game that’s going to sell a lot of Xbox 360s.|Halo 3 may not fully live up to the obscene hype, but it certainly survives it.|Combat refined. Combat perfected. But not Combat evolved. [Nov 2007, p.98]|Navigating the environments with a controller isn't as intuitive as a mouse and keyboard setup, but with a bit of patience and some experimentation… well, Bungie has seen to it that Halo 3 will probably be the most played Xbox 360 game for at least the next year.|Single-player is too similar to what has come before to earn perfect marks, whereas all other aspects are worthy of such commendation. [Issue#25, p.72]|The war, as it was, has been won. [Nov 2007, p.70]|What it comes down to is that Halo 3 is still a great playing first-person shooter that manages to get just about everything right.|The trilogy ends with a title that doesn’t bring anything really new regarding the solo campaign, but maintains the fun and appealing gameplay that this series is known for. In the end, it’s on the multiplayer front that Halo 3 shines the most, with an overwhelming number of options and exemplary support by Bungie. [Oct 2007, p.55]|A phenomenal conclusion to the trilogy, offering an epic story that is more satisfying than the second game, action on a much bigger scale and a multiplayer section that has been improved from the immensely entertaining multiplayer of the second game.|Halo 3 is a fantastic game: a magnificent example of multiplayer gaming with an enjoyable side order of single-player, but it’s really hard to justify as being a true classic.|There's no denying how awesome the replay and Forge features are – but they're not the core of the game. Don't get me wrong, the single player campaign is very strong, the action is tight, and the AI is F.E.A.R.-killing. But for every positive, there was an area of the game that left me wanting more – the backtracking, the overly cheesy storyline, the underwhelming visuals. And multiplayer feels too much like a HD-version of Halo 2 with a few gadgets you can toss around.|The story just isn't put-together well enough, the graphics are disappointing, and the levels have you constantly running back and forth. Yes, if all of these things were rectified, the game would be spectacular. But they're not.|Halo 3 is fun, and its Forge and Theater modes will provide hours of multiplayer entertainment, but nothing could've prepared us for our slight feeling of disappointment. The game's far too reliant on old gameplay tricks and recycled levels, and it really lost its narrative power.|Billions of hours are destined to be lost online as it slowly takes over the world because the multiplayer alone covers the retail price, and features such as Forge and Saved Film only further justify the purchase.|While Halo 3 doesn't force upon the player another tortuous romp through The Library, it does feature an agonizing substitute complete with seemingly endless waves of Flood victims. This--along with a handful of recycled locales in the final third of the game--is a lack of ingenuity in level design that sticks out sorely amid a slate of superbly conceived features.|Halo 3 will not revolutionize the first person shooter, nor is it taking the Halo franchise to anyplace really new. What it does do is deliver the penultimate Halo experience with improved graphics and tons of MP features.|An interesting campaign, spectacular if played in cooperative, a consistent multiplayer format with a great sense of community, but let down by some bugs and ambiguous design decisions.|Halo 3 is ""Halo 2"" with somewhat better graphics. That’s all you really need to know. If you loved ""Halo 2,"" you will feel just the same about Halo 3. If you played ""Halo 2"" and couldn’t figure out what all the fuss was about, Halo 3 is not the revelatory experience that will change your view of the series forever.|The fight might well be finished but like the end to any war, Halo 3 isn't pretty. One of the top multiplayer experiences available on any console (as expected) redeems a largely disappointing Campaign, but even that doesn't change the fact that the 'Xbox mascot' baton has passed to Fenix and his crew of COGs.|The single player campaign is not anywhere near as compelling or as epic as is billed. Anyone new to Halo probably won't see what all the fuss is about, completely confused as to why this third installment is so important to so many people. It's good, and there's enough here to make for a memorable game, but how memorable depends mostly on how invested you are in the franchise already.|There is still a lot of fun to be had with Halo 3, mostly for veterans of the series, just don't try to convince me that this is the end all be all of FPS gaming. Gamers like myself who have already seen and played ""the future"" will likely dismiss this old-school gameplay and move on to the far more visionary titles that are just around the corner.|Another disappointment is the often-clumsy ally AI. While the enemy units display proficient level intelligence, your marine companions often struggle to cope with the enemy onslaught. This is never more evident as when you’re riding alongside a CPU driver in a Warthog; they drive so erratically you half expect them to crack open a crate of Carling midway through the mission.|The best thing I can say is that if you never really cared about the single player game in the first place, you can expect to have a great time with Halo 3 for years to come. If however, you are looking to “Finish the Fight”, and don’t plan on paying for Xbox Live Gold, you would be best served to wait for a price drop or two… or three.|The ads promise an epic tale of tragedy, sacrifice, and heroism that Halo 3 really had no hope in hell of ever delivering. More troubling, however, is the fact that after playing the game, I can suggest with some certainty that they promised a game that Bungie didn't even bother trying to produce.|"

You’re doing your PS2 a disservice if you don’t see it out with God of War 2.|There are a few brilliant core improvements, such as the beautifully implemented grappling system that lets you swing around with your blades.

God of War II continues the tradition, but improves in just about every area.|Simply put, God of War II is as good as it gets on the Playstation 2. [Apr 2007, p.44]|Critics might wonder that if GoW2 turned out this good, imagine what it would have been like on PS3...yet in resisting the lure of all that next-gen horsepower Sony Santa Monica have instead crafted a sequel that somehow - amazingly - coaxes out every last drop of PS2 juice to create a fitting testament to the system.

It is a well-designed game, with terrific level design and a smooth, excellent combat system, but it also doesn't particularly bring anything dramatically different to the field.|Accessible, exhilarating and macho as all hell, it's another thunderous outing for PS2's angriest anti-hero. Essential.

Level design is more intelligent, puzzles require more thought, and the boss battles are more cinematic than ever before. In terms of the storyline, the first game has the edge.|Maybe the one notable down-side of this incredible sequel is that it is 'just' the second part of a game we all loved two years ago, and even die-hards like myself have to acknowledge that. As such, as refined and honed as the gameplay is as a whole, you can never quite replicate the wow factor of the original - even if it ends up being a better game.|God of War II just seems to go on and on, without ever resorting to needless padding or levels for the sake of it. It's one of those few games that you just don't want to finish, and surprisingly never seems to come to this climax.|The sequel to arguably the best action game on the console just got better.|And all this carnage is rendered beautifully through the game's graphics and sound. It's hard to deny that God of War II is one of the greatest looking and most epic games on the Playstation 2, but it wouldn't be much of a stretch to call it one of the best looking games on any console.|GoW2 is exactly what every action/adventure game should aspire to be. Everything from the puzzles to the action to the story are so perfectly in sync that the game becomes less of a game and more of a personal conquest.|There isn’t much else to say about this stupendous game. It is among the very best games to have graced the console, indeed it is among the best of this or any other generation.|At times the overwhelming similarities to the first game can be a little off-putting, but at the end of the day this is an action adventure of the absolute highest calibre, outstanding in every respect, and with some of the most awe-inspiring set-pieces and fantastic action sequences ever committed to a videogame.|To me there's nothing exciting about being stuck on some invisible rail smacking winged creatures out of the air only to be finished off with a series of context button commands.|A great adventure game that does everything a game is supposed to do, and while the bad habits of Hollywood march in to gaming, it still is worth every minute. Kratos could kill his way through the Mushroom Kingdom and it would be entertaining.|The action is fast, and furious, it looks damn good, and the adventure is a whole lot of fun thanks to how it embraces Greek mythology.  Top notch.|Overall God of War II shouldn’t be missed by fans of the first God of War.|It's more of the same - and at almost double the length of the first game, that's quite a lot more of the same - but it's the same widescreen awesomeness that you loved the first time around. [May 2007, p.96]|I wanted so much to experience the same sense of exhilaration that the original had given me, but that feeling never arrived. There were moments that came tantalizingly close, such as the opening battle with the Colossus of Rhodes, but it never got all the way there.|Its biggest problem is its length, and that its formula can’t quite endure its sequel-dose duration. Whether or not it’s overlong in terms of play hours may be a matter of preference, but it feels slightly stretched during its final third, exposing its shallowness a little in the process.

[June 2008, p.64]|There are a few technical issues; the frame rate does drop at times when things get hectic and there is some very noticeable pop-in when you're driving through the city.|But, more importantly, GTAIV offers such an addictive, polished, content-packed experience that previous non- to semi-fans (like myself) will finally want a piece of the gangsta' gaming action.|The pointless debate rages on whether to buy this game for the PS3 or Xbox 360, but the root of that argument is correct – you need to buy this game.|The game will most likely leave you the same sweet taste should you be one of the chosen few that understood it's message and enjoyed it's humor, and bitter because once you let go of it you have to go back to your everyday life, with it's ups and downs, with prejudice and misery, poverty and worries, in a real east-European city, with no politically correct crap to worry about.|Yeah, I had a lot of fun with it. It just wasn't something that held my attention as long as I was expecting. Single player was the golden goose.|Rockstar has delivered everything they needed to here—bigger, better, and most importantly more, more, more GTA. Simply put, it rocks.|One of the greatest video game stories ever told. It may have its flaws, but it is the most ambitious game made to date and, without a doubt, the best game so far this generation.|Grand Theft Auto IV's caricatured slice of urban Americana is a criminal masterpiece.|To borrow a Jedi phrase, ""This isn't the revolution you're looking for."" Ultimately, GTA IV ends up feeling more like an upgrade than a real sequel. Strange, considering that neither ""Vice City"" nor ""San Andreas"" received the new number designation. GTA IV has fewer substantial changes and is far less ambitious than either of its two predecessors.|At the end of the day, Grand Theft Auto IV is an amazingly good game that overcomes many of its problems.|The new art direction, investment in physics technology, and better animation sum up to a huge aesthetic improvement over previous games, giving GTA IV a level of visual appeal it strained for in the previous generation.|If you loved other GTA titles or have developed an affinity for sandbox style games then this will stay in your PS3 for months to come.|Rockstar has outdone itself yet again, with the multiplayer portions lifting the overall game, but there's still room to improve the single-player elements, which feel recycled and drag on at times.|There are issues with controls, gameplay and graphics.|The nature of the open-ended gameplay still makes for memorable random and not-so-random occurrences you'll repetitiously be reciting to friends, but for the most part it's nothing we haven't seen before.|"

It's a beautifully elegant and powerful creative tool that puts unlimited potential in the palm of your hand. [Nov 2008, p.92]|LBP is a unique game. It disguises itself as a 2D platform game but surprises the players with a set of editing tools and level sharing absolutely amazing. With a distinctive style and an everlasting future potential, we can say that Sackboy already conquered this industry. [Oct 2008]|LittleBigPlanet is like a magic trick, and in that respect it feels less like a videogame than an incredible concept executed perfectly. LittleBigPlanet is like LEGO (the blocks, not the game), it’s like Monopoly, it’s timeless... it’s lightning in a bottle – and if Sony play their cards right it could well save the PS3, and propel the console into the stratosphere.|Undoubtedly one of the finest games in recent years, LittleBigPlanet deserves every single shred of a 10. You won't find a more polished or rewarding videogame this year, and for quite some time we'd imagine.|There's really nothing I can say other than this: if you own a PS3 and you don't buy LittleBigPlanet, you are robbing yourself of one of the most unique gaming experiences ever designed.|It’s a multiplayer riot, a visual landmark, a feat of engineering, and one of the most charming games ever made. But even those accolades are dwarfed by its scope, its potential, and the apparent endlessness of them both.

It is impossible not to fall in love with all the charm LBP oozes.|Little Big Planet is just what Doctor Sony ordered: universally appealing gameplay with an appealing everyman hero that is connected to streaming delivery of new content.

The sack people are an infectiously charming bunch and as soon as you’ve settled in you’ll want to stay for the foreseeable future.|A stunning, powerfully confident title that deserves all the praise it’s ever been awarded, the Media Molecule guys should be so pleased with what they’ve managed to accomplish and just as much good feeling goes the way of Sony for putting so much faith in the game and getting behind it 100%.|When it's at its best, LittleBigPlanet offers excitement and the thrill of discovery in ways that no other console game ever has.|Media Molecule has created an amazingly fun and deep game that will allow people to create their own games and explore the creations of others.|The developers should be applauded for creating a profoundly personal work that still overtly appealing to the audience at large.

[Holiday 2008, p.56]|The online community is brimming with endlessly different styles of maps, as each of the creators' personalities are poured into the fun of constructing them.

A game for the young and the old, which can also be a competitor for the Wii.|We're just happy to see a flagship game for a modern system that's about running from left to right and jumping over things. New ideas are great, great old ideas are better, and LittleBigPlanet has both: it's the future and the past of videogames, rolled into one.|A quantum leap in concept and design, and one which falls inches - nay, millimetres - short of a perfect score. There's no better reason to own a PlayStation 3.|LittleBigPlanet may well save the PS3 (if it indeed needs saving), it may be the most creative game of all time, it could well usher in a new era of user-generated gaming, and has a chance of bringing about a 2D platforming renaissance, but all those things are down to you.

All of the textures, from a sun drenched African landscape to Sackboy's realistic looking burlap skin look amazing, as do the various special effects.|Little Big Planet is a novel, imaginative, and highly customisable platform game.|Little Big Planet could very well be a modern classic. Relying heavily on user content this game will only grow in splendor with time. The game does hold it's own though with great levels, beautiful graphics and fantastic four player co-op. A somewhat unrealised potential with regards to the controls and movement of charaters is the only thing standing in the way of a perfect score.|A fabulous platformer game and powerful editing tools in one package. Creative players will reach heaven with possibilities this game offers, and others can enjoy fruits of their work.  [Nov 2008]|Truthfully, LBP is a game rooted in production and consumption.

It manages to be both curring edge and classic simultaneously, with neither quality stifling the other. [Issue#76, p.110]|It’s fantastic, fun, beautiful, creative, and unique—pretty much everything you would want from any game and everything you would expect from a game that came with so many months of hype and excitement. With unlimited replay value and potential, you will probably be playing it for months—if not years—to come.|In reality, LittleBigPlanet is a game with all the right ingredients - maybe just not quite the right mix.|LittleBigPlanet is everything you could possibly imagine, stuffed into miniature craft based levels, and executed remarkably well, and although everyone is still getting used to the tools, there are some real gems available online already for the keen player.|LittleBigPlanet is a must have purchase for a system that needs more AAA titles in its library. As a PlayStation 3 exclusive, it's almost worth buying a system to experience.|Describing it as an online community arts program is possibly not the most enticing of descriptions, but it's nevertheless the most accurate.|As a product, LBP is amazingly solid with firm foundations outside of minor movement issues. As an experience, LBP is immeasurable and defined by the community. Let’s hope designers keep designing and further the bar as the game grows older.|Sony's exclusive title shows potential, but it has several areas that need improving. It's refreshing to see a title that has such fun gameplay and amazing customisation options, and we're sure LittleBigPlanet will be around for a long time to come.|Coupled with a robust sharing system that borrows the best elements of YouTube, LittleBigPlanet is less a game than a platform for making and downloading videogame levels.

It sets a new benchmark in terms of production values, and will blow your tiny little mind to smithereens on more than one occasion.|For anyone who appreciates games that rise above the simple act of pushing a few buttons and pulling a few triggers, Metal Gear Solid 4 is a stimulating ride that you won't soon forget.|There's just moments of absolute genius that make this game probably the best video game I've ever played - and I've played quite a few!|There is no doubt about it, but this is easily the best experience you'll have on the PlayStation 3 to date, simply nothing comes close to MGS4's presentation, story-telling, gameplay, visuals, and sound. The amount of classic homages paid to the previous games, with one in particular, will leave you breathless and, perhaps, emotional.|A one of a kind masterpiece. I doubt that any game series will ever build up to such a culmination as this one has, with so much thought, effort, and passion put into it. Hideo Kojima set out to move and excite people, to truly make a work of art, and not just a fun videogame.

It’s the surprising entertainment value of the action, the mind-blowing visuals, and the completeness of the story’s conclusion that make this last installment so satisfying. Metal Gear Solid 4’s positive qualities make it one of the most significant game releases of this generation, and anyone with an appreciation for the evolving form of the medium would do well to play it from start to finish.|Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots will surely set the bar for this generations in terms of quality, and should be the benchmark for a truly great game.|Kojima wrapped everything up in a nice little bow and gave it to us as a parting gift.

While it introduces a number of innovations, its core remains in tune with classic console gaming.|When all is said and done Metal Gear Solid 4 is exactly what the fans wanted for Snake's final mission.|The unconventional approach to delivering a triple-A game by centering the single-player game around more non-interactive elements than interactive is sure to ruffle a few feathers; the viability of different play styles might lead people to believe it's a second-rate third-person shooter; and the emphasis on omachines and PMCs, without being preachy, might be too topical for some. Regardless, right now it's one of the best-looking, engaging, and emotionally driven experiences, with the gameplay to match, on the PS3 or any console.|As the supposed last entry in the Metal Gear-franchise, this is one major release. Most of the flaws found in previous entries have been removed and the variety in gameplay and weapons is simply immense. The story is told in great part by cinematic video sequences and ingame narrative sequences, and while these are fantastic in many ways they can also become a bit tedious. These flaws are minor though, Metal Gear Solid 4 is a fantastic title in every way and a worthy finale to the franchise.|Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots is the best in the series, the best in its genre, and the best game on the PS3.|Metal Gear Solid 4 is a game that needs to be experienced, not necessarily something that can be expressed by words.|Metal Gear Solid 4 is by far one of the best games released so far this year.|It's stupid, it's nonsensical, it's over the top, it's full of awful dialogue, it demands long sittings and it hasn't changed much from the first game ten years ago. But then, it's Metal Gear Solid, so who cares? It's undeniably brilliant, captivating, exciting and downright fantastic, definitely worthy of at least a few furrowed brows throughout the experience.|Every aspect of the game – from the comprehensible storyline to the updated controls, from the white-knuckle character battles to the lengthy cutscenes – it all exudes a certain air of quality.|A hardcore gamer’s game, and it makes absolutely no concessions otherwise.|One of the most rewarding videogame experiences of the decade. Absolutely essentially, regardless whether you are a fan or not.|Dabblers and newbies will find the convoluted, metaphor-driven storyline as baffling as ever, but the tight controls and unparalleled production values should draw enough of them to make this Playstation 3 exclusive not just a big hit, but a system seller.|The comfortable gameplay and brilliant cut scenes make Metal Gear Solid 4 a great stealth shooter. There are only two disadvantages: the story is confusing and the boss fights are not as tactical as before.|There are errors and flaws that can be pointed. Thing is, no other game manages to awaken such a diverse stream of feelings in its length.

He is capable of capturing depth and emotion in his characters like few others have been able to master. This time around, he's had the help of amazing graphics to tell his story. The environments, character models, and even the little intricacies of each weapon Snake holds bring a sense of realism to the title.|Kojima claims MGS4 is Snake’s final chapter.

Often touching the line between genius and madness, he manages to build a truly epic ending to one of the most essential series in videogames history. Improving most of the elements from the previous titles, MGS 4 is a unique piece by its conception and nature, which rightly deserves the love of fans and the respect of all players.  [June 2008]|MGS4 is a masterpiece, arguably the best in the series and - though many will fiercely disagree - ever so slightly disappointing.|But where MGS4 really succeeds is in delivering an experience unlikely to ever be surpassed by Kojima ever again, providing fans everything they want to see, twists you won’t expect and more raw, lavish creativity than the video gaming medium probably deserves.|The most satisfying entry in the entire series.

[Aug 2008, p.74]|A unique, multi-layered experience that, when all is said and done, is a worthy conclusion to an important series. In addition to coming through as a sequel, the game stands as a ringing endorsement for the technical capabilities of the PlayStation 3. Some elements of the game aren’t as progressive as its technology, but taken as whole it’s still one of the most remarkable games of this generation.|Coupled with a download via the Playstation Store that’ll explain the series to you so far, this game is playable even if you haven’t been following the series for years.|Despite its intrusive storyline, Metal Gear Solid 4 is a varied, engaging and entertaining epic. It may diminish slightly towards the end of the game, but there could be no greater reward for the fans' patience than this.

Surrendering so much control to make way for movie sequences is galling, especially when the dialogue makes such a big deal about freedom and free will...Despite this gradual decay, though, MGS4 is absolutely a great game. The second half may lack sorely in comparison to the innovative, immersive brilliance of the first, but only because those early portions reach such inspiring heights.|Hours of concentrated narrative abuse can't obscure or dilute the detailed game within.|It's definitely one of the premier titles right now on the PlayStation 3.|What's perhaps most impressive is the way you'll feel about Snake by the end of the game (be sure to watch through the credits!). His character is fleshed out here more than any of the other games combined, and seeing him during his quiet moments with Otacon and Sunny gives him a lot more depth than we previously thought possible.|Metal Gear Solid 4 had a lot to live up to and it's done so brilliantly.|That about does it for Metal Gear Solid 4, it's an amazing achievement for the teams that worked on it and more than lives up to being a next-generation video game.|In case you didn't get it: Metal Gear Solid 4 is THE reason to buy a PlayStation 3!|It feels like Kojima couldn’t figure out how he wanted to end the game, and decided instead to fulfill every possible outcome that fans could want. It seems sloppy, amateur, and almost satirical.|Yet, despite my or anyone else's qualms about the game it still is a great game that can be enjoyed by anyone willing to give it a shot.|Metal Gear Solid 4 is dramatic, moving, challenging and fun, and if you own a PS3, most certainly worth checking out.|For all that, though, Guns Of The Patriots is a magnificently entertaining game.|Metal Gear Solid 4 is essentially the best game out there on the PS3, and can easily compete with any other game on any system.|The long, over-indulgent cinematic cut-scenes combined with the sometimes inappropriate odd-ball humour has had many gamers scratching their heads in confusion. Regardless of your view point though, very few could question the artistic genius behind this latest instalment.|For some reason I felt it was important to play this ""final"" chapter of the Metal Gear Solid series - mainly to see what all the fuss was about - and I have to admit that I did have fun with the game even without a background rooted in MGS lore.|Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots has over 8 hours of cutscenes. Sure, there's a good game in-between, but there are also limits to how much B-grade dialogue and contrived storyline exposition one can take in one sitting. Heavy edits to the cutscenes would've made the game so much better! [Aug 2008]|Now, on the PS3, Metal Gear has regained some, not all, of its former glory. But weak, reused bosses, a broken online game and the gameplay to video ratio keep it from the lofty standards that Metal Gear Solid set up so many years ago.|The core of the problem is that MGS4 tries to be everything to everyone and ends up falling just ever so slightly short of succeeding-- still managing to be a very good game in its own right.|The flexible and creative gameplay elements are stronger than ever, backed by arguably the best engine to date for such a game. After the conclusion of Act 2, the game enters a downward spiral, becoming more of a non-interactive movie and using less of the great gameplay of which it is obviously capable.|Guns of the Patriots is a frustrating, fractured game that turns Metal Gear Solid's world upside down several times over, but never changes it.|MGS4 is not the game it could have been; nor is it the game it would have been had the series grown with the benefit of hindsight; nor is it the game it should have been if you believed that early trailer. But it is faithful to its fans, its premise and its heart, delivering an experience that is, in so many ways, without equal.|Such intellectual depth is unusual for this medium, but to both its creator and its fans this is a deeply personal game. [July 2008, p.100]|Metal Gear Solid 4 is one of the best PlayStation 3 games. That said, its features, acceptable 10 years ago, seem foolish given the better playing games on the market. Snake's epic, final act just isn't the triple A extravaganza we expected, and it's clear that if Konami intends to continue this franchise or spin off into something new, it needs to study its competition and evolve, delivering shorter cut scenes and superior shooting.|Kojima’s cinematic direction is a massive asset to the project, but in many ways has overshadowed the core gameplay that makes it less fun to play than its predecessors for those that love the style; Play them first, they’re better games, and then you’ll forgive the weaker elements in MGS4 to see how it all plays out.|If like me you've waited a long time for this, ignore the final score, sit back and enjoy every wonderful cut-scene that Guns of the Patriots has to offer. For MGS fans, Kojima-san has delivered a masterpiece, but it's certainly an acquired taste, now more so than ever before.|It is an undeniable achievement: Hideo Kojima’s achievement. No other producer could have made this title, for better or for worse|While Guns of the Patriots boasts lashings of in-game invention and creativity that's largely wrapped up in superb style and execution, it's all so unforgivably tainted by jaw-dropping gameplay brevity that it's truly difficult to raise the many, many good points above what is, for the most part, a succession of cut scenes that leave the player with an overwhelming sense of disconnection from one of gaming's most compelling characters and interactive franchises.|When placed in the context of the Metal Gears before it, Snake’s latest and last adventure feels a touch diminutive and hollow.|Bold, ambitious and unlike anything else this generation, there lies an experience beyond several oddly disparate parts. A swansong to a breed of cinematic narrative which has finally reached its apex.|The team at Kojima Productions has at the very least set a new high-water mark for cinematic presentation that I wager any other videogame will be lucky to reach, let alone exceed, for the next few years.|"

Or when you were pulling out the Master Sword from its stone placement in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time? These were special moments in a gamer’s life and playing World of Goo deserves to be placed alongside such events.|World of Goo is a major opus. It's a charming and intelligent game, but, more than that, a mark to the genre (like Tetris decades ago), incorporating features which could not be thought before, like social critics and an atmosphere capable of leading emotion to the player, who not only plays, but observes.|It's packed full of brilliant, challenging levels.

Brawl’s chaotic multiplayer sessions are some of the best to be had on the system, plus there are plenty of challenges and modes to amuse those ‘friend-impaired’ individuals out there as well. It’s a no-brainer, every serious Nintendo fan out there should score themselves a copy of this game, invite some friends/victims around, and have a smashing good time.|I have never seen more effort put into a video game than what has been shown in Brawl. With unbelievable multiplayer fighting, an enormous single player mode, and collectibles that will last for years, there's no reason why you shouldn't buy it.|From the fighting mechanics to roster of players Brawl is a well-rounded game that I just couldn't put down. The only downside to Brawl is that it doesn't do anything to reinvent the series. It takes elements of past SSB games and refines them, which is great, but players expecting an entirely new experience won't find it here.|From the digital-crack gameplay to the ocean-deep customization to the enjoyable Subspace Emissary, it's completely jam-packed with Nintendo love. The sights, the sounds, everything is an unfiltered pat on the back and incessant in-joke for longtime fans. For everyone else, it's a dependably solid fighter that destroys its predecessor in every way.|Brawl is a good game, with solid controls, a lot of options, and not-much-better-than-the-last-one-graphics.

Controls are accurate and Brawl supports almost any pad you can plug it in. It's fast and furious and on the bonus side, Super Smash Bros. Brawl suits perfectly for the beginners and advanced gamers. [June 2008]|Nintendo love spills from every pore and the multiplayer can't be beat, but Smash Bros risks growing too familiar. It never breeds contempt, but it doesn't quite muster that Galaxy magic.|With simple to use but tricky to master controls, a useful handicap feature and a staggering variety of great characters, Brawl is the perfect competitive party game.|Controlling Brawl with the remote's D-pad feels like the devil's work and even the remote/nunchuck pairing suffers from the lack of a second analog stick - you need it for quick smash attacks. It's playable with the Wii's controllers, but seasoned smashers should grab a Classic Controller or dust off their old GC gear.

Regardless, there's still far greater good here than we could've ever expected from the game.|Super Smash Bros is a series that has often been unfairly derided as button-mashing, largely thanks to its surface sheen of cutesy characters, but it has one of the most enduringly innovative and deep systems of any fighter.

The very casual gamer will enjoy the chaos and the pyrotechnics, the hardcore gamer will love the bizarre mojo they can discover to gain their edge, but the middle of the road party player will probably soon tire of the impetus of play without being able to access the deeper mysteries.|So, yes—the online functionality is a little on the shallow, blunted side compared to that of its next-gen console peers, and there are some offputting load times…but these are minor complaints.

If both of those are in your favor, then this is definitely a game you’ll want to add to your collection. But if you aren’t big in either department, you probably won’t understand what all the fuss is about in the first place.|Perhaps by being willing to limit itself, Brawl could have been a great game. As it stands, it is simply the strongest iteration of a great series.|Nintendo's third entry in the Smash Bros series isn't just a trip down nostalgia lane - it's also a heck of a fun experience. With an insane amount of content and a gameplay begging for sessions with a bunch of friends this is a perfect addition to the series. A somewhat dodgy online mode and random events during fights mar this otherwise fantastic and frantic experience.|If you've got a few like minded friends to play with you, this is some of the best fun you can have with your Wii yet.

There's no other game, despite Killzone 2 on the visuals, with the same level of quality as Naughty Dog's newest game.

Its only flaw is a lack of real innovation for the videogame culture, although entirely made up for by an incredible merging between gameplay and cinematics.

[Christmas 2009, p.64]|Anyone who already has issues with the single-player ‘style’ of IW’s games will still find fault with the scripted, linear experience, but in terms of sheer drama and show-stopping set-pieces accompanied by laser sharp FPS controls, Modern Warfare 2 is your daddy. And that’s without Spec Ops and Multiplayer.|You're always unlocking something and messing around with your created classes to find just the right balance of tactics and murderousness.

It's an exhilarating mix that forces tension by rewarding you for taking it slowly.|Mixing real-world locations with bombastic set-pieces MW2 continues the guided, thrill-ride experiences of its predecessor, and adds even more depth to its multiplayer offerings. It might not have fixed all the problems from the first game, but there's just so much quality content packed into this game that it will almost certainly be one of the most-played games in your library for a long time to come.|The fact that I didn't even get into the stunning visuals and amazing sound design speaks volumes about the sheer amount of content in the game, and I could probably write another 800 words simply about the ridiculous attention to detail on display in each level.|The singleplayer knows no competition and the multiplayer and brilliant Special Ops-mode make Modern Warfare 2 a phenomenal package. There are truly some scenes in the game that can affect the way you think and feel. After five games, the series seems to have found its high mark. One of the best shooters ever.|It's hard to see the majority of people wanting to play any other multiplayer shooter until the next CoD is released, such is the quality of what's on offer here...Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 takes everything that was great about CoD4 and ramps it up to the next level.

An incredible package. [Christmas 2009, p.10]|The air of unpredictability and the care that was paid to each separate element puts it in lofty company.

Few games manage to meet such high expectations.|The War on Terror never rests. The same goes for Infinity Ward, who raises the bar again with Modern Warfare 2. Its new campaign keeps delivering a cinematic, inmersive, and visually spectacular experience, while polishing AI and respawn issues, and offering a minimum of 8 hours of gameplay. Without a multiplayer rival, where it's as powerful as a Tactical Nuke, including a first approach to coop, and archiving excellence in every aspect, this last Call of Duty proves itself as a very solid candidate to become the game of the year.|The surprise factor of the first Modern Warfare is missing, although it doesn’t affect this awesome sequel which is even better than the former. This new Call of Duty iteration exceeds every expectation and earns a place among the best shooters of this year.|For those planning to check out everything Modern Warefare 2 has to offer – online competition, full co-op Spec Ops mode, as well as the campaign – you’re looking at a no-brainer purchase. For the strictly single player crowd, however, Modern Warfare 2 is surprisingly short, and doesn’t live up to the standard set by previous Call of Duty games.|Perhaps the greatest feat that Infinity Ward has performed is not only living up to the hype of Modern Warfare 2, but actually exceeding it.|But value and longevity be damned, it’s the emotional impact Modern Warfare 2 brings to the table that in the end deserves the highest of praise.|Modern Warfare 2 raises the bar for online gaming making this a must have for this area alone.|Modern Warfare 2's emotional and intense single-player game is a thrilling rollercoaster ride of exciting moments, while the multiplayer is truly a definitive experience for online FPS players everywhere. This game lives up to the hype.|There was a lot of hype leading up to the release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, and for the most part the sequel lives up to it’s billing.|Infinity Ward has managed to outdo themselves with this sequel, a tremendous feat in its own right. If the games of 2009 were stacked up against each other, there’s no question that Modern Warfare 2 would be incredibly close to the apex, fighting viciously for the top spot and, for many people, getting there and continuing upward. This is what gaming is supposed to feel like.|Modern Warfare 2 is an essential purchase regardless of your affiliation with the Call of Duty brand. In short, buy this game now. That is an order, soldier.|While it may not reinvent the wheel, it makes it a much more enjoyable ride.|With the music of Hans Zimmer and the cinematic scenes, you're sucked into the game and spit out after you’re done. The single player is rather short. It will take you about six hours to beat the game, but you get an intense and memorable ride the entire time. The game seems to be a little scripted, but it isn’t annoying for everyone. The multiplayer isn’t annoying at all. You can play for hundreds of hours without being bored. The Spec Ops mode extends that with fun for two.  If you ever played a shooter and liked it, buy this game!|Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is simply a terrific game and a solid addition to the Call of Duty franchise.|Modern Warfare 2 is a complete package and one of those games you'll be playing for a long time to come. It's not only one of the best shooters of the year; it's one of the top shooters ever to appear on a console.|Absolutely one of the most rounded gaming packages of 2009. The single player campaign – while not long – is well-paced, with plenty of variety in settings and gameplay, and will definitely be a steep challenge on the harder difficulty levels. The multiplayer component is fully featured, with an expansive set of modes and maps, and it’s great to see persistent stats returning. Rounding it out is Spec Ops, which is very much the icing on the cake.|This game has so many standout moments of such immersive power, there really is no other experience out there to touch Modern Warfare 2’s controlled and entertaining pandemonium. Infinty Ward has skill, panache and big, hanging balls that clang as loud as Big Ben, so much so a the bar has been raised with Modern Warfare 2.|Improved controls, more modes, better graphics and presentation equal out to be one big non-stop gaming experience that will spoil you rotten.|Singularly the best reason to own broadband ever invented. [Christmas 2009, p.68]|The multiplayer is phenomenal, the special ops are addicting and the campaign is one of the best you’ll play. Only the relatively short length of the campaign and its accompanying story presentation issues keep this from being all it can be.|One of the best games of 2009. It has a great but short single-player. The multiplayer is brilliant and the new mode, Spec-ops is a great advantage of the series. Probably the best first person shooter of 2009.|MW2 is spectacular in all the right areas; building and refining on the most solid of bases. And although its political heart might not be in the ‘right’ place, at the very least it might make a few people think rather than skim through on muscle memory and twitch reactions. That’s a rarity in itself, and something to be respected in an age of apathy.|Modern Warfare 2 carries the good tradition of its predecessor. The campaign is nonetheless too short, and it feels too inspired to the previous one; on the other side, the multiplayer carries a lot of improvements, and Spec Ops is a well crafted coop mode. If you consider buying for online fun, this is the game that will steal your life for the months to come. If you're up to an unforgettable single player experience you might consider other more lengthy and original titles.|While at times the action can make you whiz by the environments, slowing down will allow you to take in the beauty of the environments. There isn’t quite the real-life detail as seen in the last game with Chernobyl, but Modern Warfare 2 has its own great detailing. And best of all, you won’t have any hiccups or lag.|It looks better, it plays better, the story is more intense and the multiplayer is more inviting. And with the inclusion of SpecOps, the longevity of this game is sure to have increased as well.|It’s living proof that history is written by the victors, because when people look back over the records of 2009, they’ll find more than a couple of paragraphs in Infinity Ward’s distinctive script.|At first, it may seem as MW2 is not able to surpass or even match its predecessor, but thanks to a mindblowing second half of the singleplayer-part and a solid multiplayer, it’s nevertheless an amazing experience and a definite ""must-have"" for every shooter fan.|Multiplayer is what it's all about, and here it's is head and shoulders (and torso and waist and legs and feet) above its nearest competition in terms of accessibility, balancing, strategic depth, technical prowess, and all around fun - so much so that it makes the campaign mode look like an tiny, ugly mole hidden away in some bodily crevice.|It's well worth picking up, and even if you missed out on the original, there's no reason you couldn't pick this one up and enjoy it just as much as the rest of the fans, making it one of the more accessible ""hardcore"" FPS experiences out there.|Modern Warfare 2 balances the spectacle and silliness of its single-player campaign with a deep, enduring multiplayer core, carefully covering its bases for players of all persuasions.

A singleplayer campaign crammed with set-pieces that pull the player through at breakneck speed sits alongside Spec Ops, 23 co-op missions and a MW greatest hits package, before that superlative multiplayer, which really needs no introduction. With such attractions on offer, this is a shooter that demands playing, and playing again. It is still Call Of Duty, but its execution is skilful, mostly thoughtful, and it boasts the highest of production values.|Modern Warfare 2 is the perfect example of a great sequel for a great game. This awesome first person shooter has a short but exciting story and one of the best multiplayer in the console market. The new mode, called Special Ops., is perfect to co-op with a friend for short and fantastic game sessions.|Modern Warfare 2 ticks all of the right boxes: varied gameplay, immersive story, engaging gunplay, superb multiplayer, and the list goes on... If we're being really nitpicky, then we might suggest that there aren't many innovative features in the game. However, MW2's Spec Ops mode is fresh enough to ensure that the overall package isn't a stale one, while the long-term appeal of adversarial multiplayer will stretch out until the next Infinity Ward release with ease.|Modern Warfare 2 nails the three pillars of play--campaign, cooperative, and multiplayer--to earn its place in the pantheon of modern shooters.|Ultimately, this blockbuster is just another version in the Modern Warfare franchise and whilst failing to live up to the unreachable hype that was developed prior to release, Infinity Ward have produced a very impressive title. One good enough to even convince this sceptic.|Though MW2 suffers from some of the same faults as its other ‘modern’ predecessor, its still a well made package that shows how although no game is perfect, a developer can still put out great work. If you like shooters at all, Modern Warfare 2 is the piece of work this year that you should be playing – like, right now.|While the heavily scripted and way too short campaign is a disappointment, the new Spec-Ops mode, especially when played in co-op, and the great multilayer make up for it.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is an instant classic.|Did you think you had seen it all in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare? Get ready then for this war!

And in some ways, I actually think the first Modern Warfare was better.|Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 doesn't disappoint, but doesn't meet the high expectations either. Singleplayer is intense, but short and the multiplayer is smooth, but lacks innovation. It didn't need much to begin with, since the previous multiplayer was excellent, but still... Infinity Ward can't rest on its laurels, because it's doubtful they will get away with a lack of innovation three times in a row.|As a whole, at least on consoles such as the PS3, Modern Warfare 2 is a thrilling, if not entirely coherent, care package for itchy trigger fingers."

[Feb 2011, p.91]|The Pac-Man recipe strikes again. It's a must-buy for true fans of wokka-wokka-wokka.|As far as 2010 goes, it's mightily difficult to recommend a downloadable title more than Pac-Man Championship Edition DX.|Sometimes the simplest games are the best and Pac-Man Championship Edition DX is one of those rare games that is super-easy to pick-up and play and impossible to put down.|In fact, it's the opposite: a cranked-up and damn near hypnotic high-energy sprint across a flashy, ever-shifting psychedelic racetrack. [Feb 2011, p.79]|Quite simply another brilliant title in concept and design. [Issue#67, p.100]|In the end, I'm really judging my enjoyment level of Pac-Man CE DX compared to how addicted I was to the previous title.|Seeing other companies failing to give the proper attention to their timeless classics, what Namco Bandai offers for a mere $10 cannot be overlooked, whether your a newcomer or hardened gamer.|Namco Bandai once again shows us how to take your old properties and make them relevant and fun for modern audiences. Top notch.|A perfect mix of retro and modern sensibilities that loses none of the charm or accessibility of the originals, but adds a great deal more variety.|But when the actual game is compared to the finest of its score-hungry contemporaries - Trials HD, Super Stardust HD and Geometry Wars 2 - Pac-Man Championship Edition DX is a titanic event of equal worth.|It's an absolutely hypnotic experience, one that simply feels good to play, whether in short bursts or as an alien-abduction-like time-eater. It's a game that's as timeless as the original, and while it probably won't reinvigorate Pac-Man as a cultural phenomenon, it's certainly an amazing step towards making the series relevant again.|Pac-Man Championship Edition DX introduces a number of terrific new elements that make it a superb update of the arcade classic.|Though I still don't know what a perfect game of DX looks like, the fact that I'm still glued to it (despite -- at this point -- finishing what I estimate to be maybe one actual five-minute game in any given hour) should give you a pretty clear idea of how I feel about it.|Pac-Man Championship Edition DX is as an exhilarating experience as its sibling, and provides enough differences from the previous game to make the aggressively priced 800 MSP title a worthy addition to your XBLA collection - a single go will have you gagging for more.|Lest you fear that all the challenge has gone, let me ease your mind. Pac-Man DX ascends to mind-shattering speeds in a hurry, demanding fast minds and thumbs both.|While it's still puzzling why the developers seem so reluctant on including some sort of simultaneous multiplayer action, Championship Edition DX is unbelievably fun and mercilessly addictive, enhancing the timeless appeal of Toru Iwatani's original coin-op design to frantic and eye-catching levels.|Simply a masterpiece.

It's so funny and polished you really can't miss it.|Unmatched combination of simplicity and fun in one of the best games in history, which again demonstrates that after 30 years its gameplay is still strong enough to engage us in our new consoles.|Pac-Man made better. [Feb 2011, p.103]|Pac-Man has received a facelift. The well-known bleeps that we know and love are now accompanied by a technobeat, the pace of the game is much faster and neonlights give the game a modern look. More importantly, the old concept of the game has been altered so that there's an original twist in every level.|It's a more immediate and instantly gratifying variant of the classic game than any that have come before, but you have to wonder if all this pyrotechnic pizzazz doesn't come at the expense of long-term score attack potential. [Issue#104, p.123]|With ten different courses to select and multiple challenges for each (mostly time trials and score challenges), there's quite a bit to Pac-Man Championship Edition DX to keep players busy.|What a formidable tribute this Pac-Man Championship Edition DX is for the 30th birthday of Pac-Man. Addictive, thrilling, psychedelic, this frenzy-inducing downloadable title reinvents the classic gameplay with subtleness, without spoiling the substance of the original. Being able to refresh such an oldie without crushing it... kudos !"

Only one question remains: How long will we have to wait this time, Blizzard?|Somehow, Blizzard has managed to make StarCraft II feel instantly familiar, while still keeping the entire game feeling fresh and new. The single-player is ridiculously fun, the multiplayer is as addictive as hell, and virtually every new mechanic Blizzard has introduced has helped to improve the game.|I am stunned. The long time waiting between ""StarCraft"" and StarCraft II has not been wasted. Flawless gameplay, great graphics and a bombastic atmosphere result in one of the best real-time strategy games in the world.|Starcraft II has certainly been long overdue, but the immense waiting has really paid off. Blizzard have another jewel to add to their crown, and it's easy to see why. By not veering too far away from the original formula, Blizzard haven't at all 'played it safe' – they've recognized a gaming model that works and then given it a much needed 21st century polish.|The title is simply more of the same, but it's been polished to the point that it would be difficult to make it any more modern without losing the franchise's strong core. It might be off-putting that the campaign only centers around one race, but in spite of that, the game is a surprisingly full experience.|Perfectly balanced multiplayer with old school elements intact, and rich and dynamic single player campaigns.

It might not revolutionize the genre, but it doesn't allow itself any shortcomings either. The campaign is exciting, the cutscenes are awesome and the multiplayer is in a league of its own.|I doubt it will completely repopularize the genre as we once knew it, since the world has moved on in the past decade or so. But StarCraft 2 does have mainstream gamers talking about build orders and micromanagement, which is honestly something I never thought I would hear again. Just in that, I consider StarCraft 2 a minor miracle.|If you are into real time strategy in any form, it's hard to ignore Starcraft II.|Though I finished the game in less than a week, it was the first game in long time that I couldn't get out of my head when I wasn't playing it, and didn't move from my chair when I was playing it.

[Oct 2010, p.56]|StarCraft II can be considered a refined version of its parent: so, despite the fact that perfection has been reached once again, we admit we expected a little bit more of innovation after 12 years waiting for this sequel. Anyway, it's a ""must buy"" for every RTS fan.|StarCraft 2: Wings of Liberty is as good as expected, but you'll need to be patient with it. The game takes some time to get going and behind all the upgraded technologies it's still the same StarCraft we've been knowing for 12 years. It's the best real-time strategy game of the last years and while not perfect, StarCraft 2 is a real masterpiece of PC gaming and even better as a multi-player game.|Given its lineage, it should hardly be surprising to discover that Blizzard has once again demonstrated such a keen sense of balance: with Wings Of Liberty, it offers established players a welcome return to familiar battlegrounds, while providing intrigued bystanders with their best chance yet of engaging with a bewildering, brilliant and punishing genre.|StarCraft 2 doesn't really do anything to grow the RTS as an actual game - much of what SC2 does better is in the area of matchmaking and social networking, which betters the player experience. The gameplay is very similar, with most changes existing simply to meet current RTS standards.|It has its faults, yes, but Wings of Liberty will certainly be ""THE game"" for some time to come.|And, more to the point, because millions will thoroughly enjoy StarCraft II regardless, thanks to a dense, thrilling, relentlessly clever and class-leading campaign adventure that takes this RTS to the masses in spite of itself. It might be less than half this sumptuous package, but it's a lot more game than almost anything else.|Starcraft 2 is a stunning example of a developer who really knows their thing. It doesn't attempt anything too bold, but accomplishes everything it does with absolute skill and panache. 12 years may seem like a long time to wait for a sequel that stays very close to the original format, but it's hard to think of another game that comes together quite as well as Starcraft 2.|An excellent game that you can consider the chess of the 21st century.|Sure, you might miss playing as Zerg and it does have a somewhat old feeling to it. But nevertheless, this is an extremely good strategy game that gives the fans exactly what they've been waiting for since the original Starcraft was released 12 years ago.|The lack of innovation is a shame, but the attention to detail and superb multiplayer is beyond criticism.|In strict numbers: 60 euros for a 15–20 hours single-player experience plus months or years of endless fun in multi-player is an unbeatable price/value ratio. [Issue#195]|Much like the original, it will be played for years to come. And that's why it lives up to all the anticipation.|StarCraft II proves that old game mechanics can still work if done right. The game is fun to play in singleplayer, but its true excellence is stated in the best realtime strategy multiplayer yet to date. It´s an instant classic which will be played in many years to come.|Starcraft II not only picks up the essential features that made the first game of the franchise a success as joins them with high production values that transmit a very strong cinematographic component to the whole experience.|With a great story, memorable characters and outstanding cutscenes the single player campaign easily overcomes most of its very few shortcomings. And the multiplayer mode is exactly what we've come to expect from Blizzard: it is fast, unforgiving and a hell of a lot of fun.|Those who expected some kind of a revolution in the StarCraft gameplay with this sequel will probably be disappointed, but the argument doesn't stand for long in front of this tour de force, making StarCraft II the new reference of RTS on PC, and certainly for a long time.|Working alongside a terrific soundtrack, some very cool voice acting, and a custom map building tool, the parts of Starcraft II that make it an enjoyable and addictive ride leave little to be desired.|It's not a step forward for the genre, exactly, but StarCraft II is still one of the most polished, finely crafted and well presented real-time strategy games available.|Wings of Liberty is one of those games PC-gamers have been waiting a long time for. The huge single-player and incredibly balanced multiplayer make for a very complete package. Here's to another twelve years of Starcraft, even if you're not a huge fan of RTS-games (yet).|Bilzzard offers us an engrossing and well crafted single player campaign combined with a multiplayer mode crafted to perfection in StarCraft II. You won't find any other real time strategy game that comes close to this level of craftsmanship. Add to this meaty options for content creation and what you get is a game well worth the long wait.|Engrossing. [Issue#100, p.128]|Blizzard's remarkable gift for story-telling is now embodied in yet another game. For this very reason, there are probably few people out there who won't be lured by the narrative, marvelously animated cut-scenes, stunning art direction worthy of any preceding achievement from Blizzard, in addition to the carefully crafted characters.|So StarCraft 2 is in essence StarCraft 1 with a new shiny coat of paint on it.|Starcraft may be good, but there's a big, nagging complaint I have: Starcraft 2 is Starcraft 1 with prettier graphics but fewer features.|The multiplayer is so smooth, so challenging, and so much plain-old-fun that I can only think of one RTS I ever played that is outright better. The single-player is weaker, in many ways, than that of other RTS titles -- but hey, you don't have to play it, after all. And so, the line you've all been waiting for: Yes, Blizzard has indeed done it again.|StarCraft II is not ground-breaking. It will not have the same lasting impact on gaming that its predecessor did. There's no way it ever could. It will, however, be remembered as a worthy sequel to one of the all-time greats.|If development of multiple bases, careful upgrades planning and intricate micromanagement make your blood boil, you will embrace StarCraft 2. Had it been released 7 years ago, we would have wholeheartedly recommended it to anyone even remotely interested in the RTS genre. But that era is gone now. Today, StarCraft 2 is just a remedy for nostalgia.|Don't get me wrong. Starcraft II is a fine game. It's just not great.|"

One of the best games in history.|So back to the big question at hand: is Skyrim too much like Oblivion to the point where it loses credibility? In a word, no.

Definitely a candidate for game of the year. [Issue#204]|So do we need Portal 2? Do I need it? Maybe not, but I'm sure as hell glad it exists. The portal aspect has probably reached its zenith in Portal 2, and given the way the game ends I don't think there's much room for a Portal 3.|Portal 2 exceeds every expectation. It has a smart story, hilarious dialogs and the most refined multi-dimensional puzzles ever created. [June 2011, p.78]|Like its predecessor, Portal 2 is not an adventure game in the traditional sense, but genre fans will find plenty to appreciate in this story-driven obstacle course, because puzzle games don't get any better than this.|Pile on the ""Oh, yes!"" moments of solving some really great puzzles, and there's every reason to start thinking about Game of the Year accolades. It's that good.|Impatience aside, Portal 2 is an exceptionally well-crafted, intelligent, entertaining, humorous game. You will laugh. You will feel like a freaking genius. You will want more. And yes, you will probably be hearing quotes from Portal 2 for the next three years.|Sporting some of the best writing and voice work in years (as well as some deviously designed puzzles), Portal 2's single-player campaign is superior to its predecessor in every way. It's the co-op mode, however, that makes this 2011's first must-play game -- even for those gamers that don't like first-person or puzzle games.|In conclusion, Portal 2 is a textbook example of how to make a great game, but nothing more.|Portal 2 couldn't be Portal, but it's the next best thing. It's a longer, funnier, more emotional plummet through Aperture's perplexing laboratory, and its meticulous detail, perfect pacing, and kinetic, mind-expanding puzzles make it a blazingly memorable experience.

It's a game that not only seamlessly blends puzzle and adventure elements together, but makes a name for itself as a true ""comedy"" game, where witty dialog and laugh-out-loud concepts have been given an equal billing with the gameplay itself.

We've wanted to shout from the rooftops about how Portal 2 not only betters the original Portal, but completely annihilates it...If you thought the original Portal was a masterpiece, prepare to have your mind blown.|Portal is perfect. Portal 2 is not. It's something better than that. It's human: hot-blooded, silly, poigt, irreverent, base, ingenious and loving. It's never less than a pure video game, but it's often more, and it will no doubt stand as one of the best entertainments in any medium at the end of this year. It's a masterpiece.|A mere ten minutes here will yield more memorable moments than you're likely to squeeze out of the entirety of most other games this year. In all aspects of its design, Portal 2 is genius.|Despite being so much bigger than the original, I actually felt a little melancholy once Portal 2 was over, simply because it's so rare to find a game this smart, this funny, and this rich with detail. It elevates Portal from an odd, memorable experiment to one of the most significant series in Valve's stable with a unique voice and an incredible level of quality that all developers should aspire to.|Portal 2 may be the best game of 2011. It may be the best game of all-time. It is certainly the best game you can play right now. I loved every moment I spent with Portal 2. I'm even enjoying looking at the game sitting on my shelf knowing how much fun I will have again someday when I revisit Aperture Science, alone or hopefully with a friend who may not have played the game. Portal 2 proves that you don't have to kill things to make a great game and more importantly…science is fun!|Portal 2 is better in every possible way when compared to its predecessor. The writing is brilliant and the voice actors have managed once again to bring the robots to life perfectly. Valve proves to be an amazing developer and brings us what could be the best game this generation has ever known.|It's hard to sum up a game like Portal 2. It doesn't have enough shooting to be a shooter, but it's not abstract enough to be a puzzle game. It's unique and challenging enough to attract the hardcore, but its offbeat humor and intuitive design will make it a hit with casual players.|It starts slowly and at first might seem like an expansion, but it has many epic moments waiting for you. It is not the perfect game, but comes dangerously close.|Portal 2 has an enormous warmth that makes it easy to adore, even when you're up against its many frustrating brainteasers.

Truly an exceptional experience that almost any gamer should give at least one go.|A truly fantastic game, a worthy sequel in almost every way and a joy to play. It may not pack the surprise-factor of the original game – a fact which deprives GlaDOS especially of much of her early power – but it's still just as fun, fast, funny and fantastic as we'd expect a second Portal game to be.|Portal 2? Simply awesome. Period.|Portal 2 is fantastic.  Its single-player provides ample amounts of genuinely funny and compelling narrative and some great puzzles, while the co-op takes the game's mechanics and pushes them to their absolute, playable limit.  You're only getting around 10-12 hours after delving into both halves of the game, but it's a concentrated thrill, where its weakest moments are still standards that most developers can barely reach in the first place.|Fantastic writing, excellent gameplay, and a level of polish and playtesting so high that you know it's got to be a Valve title, Portal 2 is simply a game that can not be missed.|The writing is without peer and its execution brilliant, with the voice-over performances and details in visuals/animations rivaling anything Pixar has done on film.

GLaDOS is back to make our life difficult. It doesn't allow us out of this hell that is the Aperture laboratory. Vegetation, more puzzles and many new challenges for one or two players.|The very short duration and lack of multiplayer were the most important shortcomings signaled by the community regarding its predecessor, so Portal 2 came to directly solve these problems, while at the same time further evolving the gameplay that was so beloved by millions of fans. If Portal was an experiment, a child who didn't know if he'll reach adulthood, Portal 2 can be seen as the teen years of the series.

The story is richer story this time around too.|A hilarious slice of gaming glory. [July 2011, p.92]|Portal 2 is a finely polished experience that you should not miss. It is also fairly short but ultimately that isn't the biggest issue - the chronic lack of challenge for those of us that already know how to ""think with portals"" is. A lot is saved by the excellent co-op mode but I weep for the missed opportunities.|A must-have for every games looking for a clever, funny and original challenge. Portal 2 offers lots of surprises and twists and has been tuned just right to be challenging, but not frustrating. The level design is fair and keeps the motivation high until the end.|Almost as good as the first one. Main reasons are lack of cake, unfunny Wheatley and slightly boring one-solution middle-levels.  Otherwise Portal 2 is as clever as it is well written. And now Half-Life 2: Ep 3, please. [May 2011]|The graphics may not be of the same caliber of other AAA titles, and the story may falter from time to time, but those are paltry excuses not to experience one of the best current generation games around.|Portal 2 is an excellent game. Maybe not as powerful as the first one, as it's a different one, but it's intelligent, witty and scathing.

For some the overall playthrough time might be too short though, but Aperture is a place to visit again and again.|Portal 2 delivers, and it does it in style, creating one of the most meticulously designed, thrilling and delightful playgrounds we've ever seen. It's a game with a magical take on momentum, where single bounds over tall buildings are business as usual, where every surface is a potential launchpad, and the entire experience is a belly laugh.|Portal 2 expands on everything the first game did so well and makes it even better. Perfectly paced and adorably funny from start to finish, Portal 2 will keep on surprising you and challenge your wit right to the finish. In brief, everyone should play Portal 2, alone or with a friend.|Ultimately, the biggest problem with Portal 2 is Portal 1, which was a lean mean meme machine driven by one of videogaming's most unforgettable characters. So when the sequel has a minor negative space problem, and closes with a credit sequence that I can't hum for the life of me, is Portal 2 ever so slightly disappointing, or was Portal 1 just flat-out ingenious? I suspect a little of both. But with this much awesome Stephen Merchant, and with my status as a frickin' genius puzzle solver reaffirmed, and with a unique co-op experience, it's like complaining that I was promised the moon and the stars, but I only got the moon.|What Portal 2 gains in cinematic narrative presentation, it loses in puzzle-solving ponderousness. It will delight you and entertain you, but it will not fill you.

It would surprise me if Nintendo in the future doesn't feel the need of releasing a new console with a battery that lasts longer between recharges, since that is the biggest issue with his remake.

If you don't and have never played it, then definitely give it a shot.|Ocarina of Time is still just as much fun to play. The gameplay turned out to be as timeless as we hoped for and the graphics have been improved to compete with nowadays standards. There are a few points of irritation that show that Ocarina of Time 3D is the remake of a thirteen year old game, but don't diminish the game whatsoever. This is still meant to be played by gamers of all ages and sizes.|One of the greatest adventure games of all time in it's finest edition. Improved graphics and smart use of the touch screen for the equipment.|Without a doubt, I think that The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D is worth picking up for 3DS owners. While I've enjoyed a couple of other 3DS titles since the system's release, Ocarina of Time is the first game on the system that makes it feel like a must-have device.|WIRED One of the best games ever, remastered; looks fantastic in 3D; improved controls. / TIRED It's the same game you played 12 years ago and remember exactly how to beat.|It sets a new standard for modern remakes of past-generation titles, proving that there's absolutely nothing wrong with a publisher capitalizing on gamers' nostalgia, so long as they can find a developer who loves the source material just as much as -- if not more than -- we do.|A sterling example of epic 3D adventure done right -- the likes of which you won't find on any portable until Nintendo announces an original adventure or gives The Wind Waker the 3D treatment. I'd prefer something new, but if I'm going to relive decade-old stories, this is a helluva way to do it.|In short, it's given me a new perspective on a classic that I had (foolishly) written off. It's not quite enough to sell me on owning a Nintendo 3DS; but if you've already taken the plunge, Ocarina of Time 3D is pretty much the best 3DS game on the market right now. I can't promise that it'll give you a new perspective on the series as it did for me, but I can promise that it's still one fine adventure.|A wonderful remake of one of the best video games of all times. The new graphics and the 3D effects are looking awesome. Master Quest and the Boss Battles are great. But always remember: The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D is only a remake.|For those who never experienced Ocarina: Play this visually enhanced version. For those who already played it, there is little incentive to do it again on the 3DS, since there is nothing new.|The definitive version of gaming's most revered and respected adventure. From obvious graphical touches to minor gameplay tweaks, Ocarina 3DS updates an aging classic and makes it presentable to an entirely new generation of adoring fans.|An excellent remake of the much loved Nintendo 64 classic: refreshed, renewed but still very much familiar and fun.|Quotation forthcoming.|Ocarina of Time returns in Nintendo 3DS with an epic remake made for both fans and new players. A timeless legend which travels in time to present without losing the great gameplay and values that led to success in late 90's.|Though its roots show through from time to time, the improved visuals remove any barrier of entry that age may have posed. The new elements enhance the core adventure to create the definitive version of this classic game, making Ocarina of Time 3D the best way to embark on (or relive) this landmark adventure.|The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D has been left almost untouched by the passing of time. It was a masterpiece, and still it is, but maybe the 3DS version is not the best one, lacking a little in graphics and audio quality. Anyway, a title that everyone should enjoy with delight.|As a portable gaming enthusiast, I love being able to play a game of this quality on the go. I just wish as much attention had been paid to the nuts-and-bolts of the game as was lavished on appearances.|For Zelda fanatics, this re-release of one of the best Zelda titles out there seems like it could be a cash grab – but the additions, especially the great use of the 3DS graphical prowess and the 3D itself make it a must purchase for all gamers, new and old.|Everything that made Ocarina of Time one of the greatest games ever is still in the 3D version, but all it does is make you reminisce for a simpler time and a better controller.|Not entirely a bad remake – the great adventure catches everyone but controls are clumsy and 3D effects are far from what we expected.

No one else (literally) is making games like this and if you've somehow avoided a modern day Persona title you owe it to yourself to give Golden a shot. It's sweet icing on a delicious cake.|Persona 4: Golden is amazing. The story is great, combat system endlessly interesting, characters are all well done, there's tons to do and it's received some improvements regarding the original. It's also pretty accessible for a JRPG. It might be fantastic, but it never gets ridiculous. Do yourself a favor and pick this game up.|While the game doesn't do much of note besides bringing the 2008 title to the HD era, it doesn't need to. The story hooks you, dungeon crawling makes for a great time, and exploring your relationships while building a better army is the kind of tinkering you can get lose hours to.|Persona 4 Golden manages to make a classic JRPG even better. A definite buy for any Vita owners, and actually a good enough reason to justify the purchase of Sony's struggling handheld. [Apr 2013]|If you’ve been thinking about dipping your toes into the JRPG scene, you absolutely must put this at the top of your list.|Atlus goes the extra mile with an exceptional remake that is full of new features. Persona 4 Golden will captivate you from the very beginning, offering not only a very addictive experience, but also a very entertaining one, with the perfect combination of role-playing and social simulation. Both aspects coexist in perfect harmony, making this game one of Vita's must have titles.|A PS Vita ""rebuild edition"" of one of the most excellent and beloved JRPG from the PS2 era. One of the best titles developed for the console.|Persona 4 Golden is part detective novel, part teenage simulation and part asian RPG – all being important pieces which combine to create some of the most memorable and entertaining moments I’ve ever had with a JRPG.|A little gem that will reward you with many hours of fun.|Refreshingly different. [March 2013, p.108]|One of the last years best RPG just got even better. This is the one game for the format that you really can't afford to miss.|Persona 4 Golden is full of surprises. Perhaps the biggest is that a console JRPG is so well suited to portable play, and that a four-year-old PS2 game is, by some distance, Vita’s best game to date.|The long awaited porting of Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4 is finally available in Europe on PlayStation Vita, with new content and gameplay additions. Persona 4 Golden improves every aspect of the original game and offers an intense and rewarding game experience. A must-buy for Vita owners and one of the best Japanese RPGs ever.|After four years Persona 4 is back in a well packed edition, which gives credit to the original game and is well suited to the hardware of the Playstation Vita.|Persona 4: Golden is the perfect example of a well-done remake. Atlus expanded the already awesome original experience, enhancing the graphics and adding high quality extra contents. This is one of the most interesting PlayStation Vita games.|True, it can be exasperating and tedious, but it can also be touching and insightful and supremely gratifying. [March 2013, p.78]|Broadly speaking, this is the same game we've played before on PS2, but the addition of fresh personae and social links, and the sheer range of activities available at any one time did much to dissipate our expected fatigue.|A lack of real Vita innovation lets it down somewhat, but that aside this is a perfect pocket-sized JRPG that'll keep you gripped to the screen until your eyes turn square. A must-have for any Persona fan.|This is not a perfect game, and it never has been, but Persona 4 has always been our favourite Japanese role-player and this is the definitive version of it.|Thematically, too, Persona 4 has real impact. Ostensibly, this is a game about being a teenager living in extraordinary circumstances - but beneath the murder-mystery premise, it's easier to relate to than that. It's a game about negotiating the murky waters of adolescence, rolling with the hurtful buffeting of pubescent relationships, grappling with self-image, peer pressure and modern life's demand that we all grow up quicker than our parents did.|It never ceases to amaze how Atlus manages to make Japanese games that lose none of their appeal in their translation to the West. Even though this is totally banking on it's Nippon slice of life approach, its no less compatible with western audiences than any other RPG. This is an approachable and sympathetic cast of characters going through relatable hardships – you don't need to be an anime fan to get that. In light of the Vita's situation you might not want a reason to get one of Sony's struggling portables. Now you have one nevertheless.|A wealth of new content and gameplay additions make a modern role-playing classic better than ever in Persona 4 Golden.|Persona 4: Golden proves as endearing, powerful, and emotionally charged as it did in 2008, but with a host of new features and newcomer crutches, the experience can't be beat. Despite a few small hiccups, including the odd one-hit kill from an unassuming shadow, Golden manages to yank at your heart and delight in even servings. There's no better game for your Vita this holiday season.|Persona 4 Golden sports a phenomenal amount of content packed into a single card. One of the PlayStation 2's greatest role-playing games of all time graces the Vita with slick, vivid aesthetic improvements, loads of additional areas to explore, and tons of reasons to come back even if you've beaten the game into the ground.|Persona 4 Golden is a fantastic modernized expansion of a brilliant RPG that many will have missed simply because it released out of sync with its original console generation.|This is a beautiful monster of a game. It is as sad as it is remarkable that this PS2-classic might be the best thing happening to Vita users for the whole year.|Persona 4 Golden's greatest strength is that everything fits together seamlessly, from the connected battle and social aspects to the fresh changes. Newcomers are sure to find plenty to love, while series veterans can revisit fond memories and experience new content. This game still remains one of the best RPG to date; don't miss out on your second chance to experience it.|Persona 4 Golden is a Tardis of a game. Initially, it seems cute and friendly and it hooks you with its murder mystery and time management focus. Once you get inside, it opens up exponentially, awing you with its scope. [March 2013, p76]|It's a shame the graphics didn't receive an upgrade and we don't understand why the Japanese voices aren't included, but other than that this port of Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4 is a great PlayStation Vita title. The game still has lots of features and possibilities, and is covered with a tasteful layer of JRPG influences.|While technically sound, even with its enhancements Persona 4 Golden is still a port of a PS2 game. There was only so much the system can do, so if you're expecting something that will utilize the potential of the Vita, you won't find that here.|As much as I found myself groaning through the parts I knew I would dislike-namely, the grinding and overwhelming sense of repetition that emanates from combat and time management-I grew to respect Persona 4: Golden. I can't say I completely enjoyed my time with the game, but I'm not the kind of person who would be interested in buying it. Those who are will find an admirably polished JRPG and a welcome addition to their burgeoning Vita library."

[August 2013, p70]|The Last of Us is a sobering conclusion to Naughty Dog’s relationship with the PlayStation 3. It is the studio’s finest game to date, marrying gameplay and fiction better than any of the Uncharted games. It’s sometimes haunting, sometimes beautiful, but more than anything else it feels real, and both you and Joel are very much vulnerable to it.|It's not a big surprise the game is good. Surprising is it's even better than anyone would have thought. A beautiful and atmospheric game with many moments only Alzheimer will hide them from you. [Issue#231]|There was no violence for violence sake, everything felt like it was done with perfect context. The writers and those that acted in the game all deserve a lot of credit, it was one of the most amazing experiences I have ever had with a controller in my hands.|The Last of Us is the type of game that could only be crafted by a developer willing to take risks. Were Naughty Dog to have thrown its money at yearly iterations of Uncharted, it would likely still have found its audience, but with The Last of Us it has struck out in a bold new direction that asks some very big questions about some of the fundamental aspects of videogame culture and the relationship that exists between gamer and game.|The Last of Us is a masterful tale of two individuals who are both authentic and flawed. It creates one of the most memorable video game experiences I have ever played and I believe its the best game to come out in the last ten years.|The Last of Us is truly what a game can aspire to. It’s a full interactive experience package.|It effectively closes out this generation on a high note while simultaneously raising expectations for gaming storylines and their presentation in the next console generation.|The game hits all the right notes and proves that Naughty Dog really knows how to design interesting, gorgeous and enjoyable games.|At the end of the day, one detail is all that matters about the The Last of Us: its single-player campaign. Naughty Dog has taken what it’s learnt from crafting the Uncharted franchise and spun that experience into a more down-to-earth, realistic adventure that shines with storytelling excellence, great combat, tense atmosphere and the highest quality in presentation, making The Last of Us one of Sony’s best exclusives for the PS3’s ever-growing library of great games.|A masterpiece of storytelling and modern game design.|Cutting your teeth on astonishingly good-looking and immaculately presented fluff pieces and then going ahead to produce arguably the darkest game of this generation – that's the sort of trick only the real heavyweights can pull off. Naughty Dog's game ain't begging for sympathy, it doesn't care if you like it or not. As such, it's a wake-up call for the medium, determined that the line isn't drawn between good and evil or right and wrong, but between you and the others.|Naughty Dog has proven itself again as one of the most accomplished development teams in the world. With The Last of Us they have given us a consistent and interesting world that is supported by practically all of its game mechanics. From the rich complex combat system to the sublime sound design, this game immerses the player in one of the most visceral plots in this generation. Maybe the AI could have been better, but, overall, this game proves how far the craftsmanship of making video games has come.|In atmosphere and narrative, Naughty Dog knows few barriers, and turning their talent and craftsmanship to such haunting and profound subject matter will ensure that the developer is poised to continue its domice as a premier auteur development studio well into the next generation of console hardware.|Is it possible for a title of a dying platform to become a game of the year? The Last of Us is a hot candidate not because it has amazing graphics, but because it has a solid storyline for the generic post-apocalyptic genre. The game proves in a remarkable way that even a great thing may be even greater, and that a whole thing may be even more than just a sum of the individual components.|With The Last of Us, developer Naughty Dog has not only created a modern classic, but also one of the finest gaming experiences of all time. The fact that they set a new bar for interactive storytelling almost seems like a bonus.|The Last of Us is not a cheerful story, but it's a damned good one.|An assured, touching, and engrossing adventure, The Last of Us represents a watershed moment for the medium. The unlikely bond that blossoms between the title’s two lead characters is both heartrending and poigtly paced – but the release delivers much more than captivating cinematics. This is a meaty slice of survival action that masterfully depicts the horrors of life in a post-pandemic setting.|Here the developers have carefully pieced together something rarely seen in the industry – a considerably more substantial, meaty take on the saturated third person adventure genre, and one that surprises at every turn without wrong-footing a player ready to invest serious time and emotion into the project. A real achievement, and one that respects you as an adult.|It would be disingenuous to suggest that The Last of Us is immune from blockbuster video game excess --the total number of kills at the final stats page will still run into the many hundreds-- but it’s one of the few games to try and make some kind of sense of it without compromising its quality of action...In that, and so many other things, The Last of Us is a triumph.|It’s a hallmark of excellence in writing, design, and performance. Naughty Dog and Sony not only have a system seller on their hands, but a game that’ll define an entire console generation—a true classic that’ll be talked about and fondly regarded for years to come.|The Last of Us is visually arresting, mechanically solid, maturely written and by turns heart-rending, tense, unnerving and brutal. Check your ammo. Grab your shiv. Just try your best to stay alive.|There's no denying it: The Last of Us hits almost every nail on the head. Its storytelling, its gameplay, its characters, and their journey in this bleak but almost sadly beautiful world that saw the downfall of the human civilization doesn't ever really try to shortcut its way to genuine emotions, opting, on the contrary, for the hard but humanely faithful path. The ambivalence of the human soul, the spot on portrayal of conflicting morals and the tragedy of impossible choices are all beautifully written and played. Plus, the multiplayer is far from being a gimmick; quite the contrary, in fact. It's very much a coherent and enticing experience on its own, with a brilliant meta-game idea, and a unique, multiplayer take on survival.|The Last of Us is what we expected and more, much more. Naughty Dog delivers the game that made our jaws drop at E3: adult, honest and with an incredible attention to detail.|A masterpiece, that breaks the self imposed barriers of gaming narrative and ensnares the player with intelligent gameplay and brilliant A.I. Anyone wanting to tackle the same themes will have to be compared to Naughty Dog's work in the future, and it won't be pretty.|A masterpiece. Superb graphics, challenging gameplay, great story, believable characters and the eeriest clicking noise you've ever heard in a video game.|Its storytelling is peerless, as affecting and multi-layered as it is grounded, underplayed and real. In terms of everything the modern action game has strived to be, The Last of Us is the full-stop at the end of the sentence, leaving no more to be said. Until next-gen. If this is our starting point for that, then the next five to ten years could be truly amazing.|In an industry where big, epic, and huge are the normal, it is refreshing to see the importance of the little things. In fact, I believe this is The Last of Us’ strongest suit. You will play this game and feel the overwhelming storyline, like the characters, and, after you have let it all soak in, some of your favorite moments will be the small things; the things you didn’t have your hand held through.|When such a talented developer hits these creative, narrative and technical heights, the result is a game that wouldn’t look out of place smuggled into PS4’s launch lineup. The acting is more believable than LA Noire’s hi-tech gurning. There are sneaky set-piece excursions that outdo even Metal Gear Solid 4 at its best. And tying it all together is an utterly mesmerising world instilled with a seamless sense of time and place. This is a work of art in which amazing sights and sounds fuel an emotionally draining, constantly compelling end of days adventure.|Ultimately, I defy anyone not to be moved when it comes to its conclusion and the huge questions it asks of both the player and the characters themselves – any game that achieves such a goal deserves high-praise. The Last of Us succeeds in the same way as the best movies do, challenging you more than you'll ever expect, demanding that you think and discuss it weeks after it resolves. The fact I had the urge to pick it up again almost instantly is just added acclaim it has more than earned.|Naughty Dog has delivered the most riveting, emotionally resot story-driven epic of this console generation. At times it’s easy to feel like big-budget development has too much on the line to allow stubbornly artful ideas to flourish, but then a game like The Last Of Us emerges through the crumbled blacktop like a climbing vine, green as a burnished emerald.|The Last of Us is a deeply impressive demonstration of how it can and should be done. It starts out safe but ends brave; it has heart and grit, and it hangs together beautifully. And it's a real video game, too. An elegy for a dying world, The Last of Us is also a beacon of hope for its genre.|Its unrivaled presentation in particular sets the bar even higher than the Uncharted trilogy already did, and its writing, voice acting and layered gameplay combine to create what is very easily the game to beat for Game of the Year 2013.|It cannot be said enough, however, that Naughty Dog's new best creation is complete, and when I say complete, I mean it to pay the highest of compliments. I do not want more from The Last of Us: I do not need more. As the last line was uttered and the credits ushered in the close, I was done. The Last of Us had achieved everything it needed to achieve in order to provide me with everything I wanted...And it ended perfectly.|The Last of Us is not simply Uncharted with zombies, but it couldn't exist without Naughty Dog having made Uncharted first, either. It's a dark adventure, one rarely filled with laughs or joy. There are bitter pills to swallow along the way, and nothing is taken for granted, not even characters. People live, people die. Sometimes it's fair, sometimes it's not. It's still a zombie game, but a sobering one. Take a deep breath.|Overall, multiplayer is light on modes and it may not expand on the core story-driven experience, but it’s still a thoughtful addition to a superbly executed package.|It cannot be overstated that there is something exceptional at work here as masterful storytelling marries wonderfully with interactive experience, the high expectations that have built for this release are met and exceeded with consummate ease.|With a hauntingly beautiful game world, stunning visuals, and a wide variety of ways in which players can approach combat, The Last of Us is another exceptional game from the team at Naughty Dog...However, it's the studio's ability to make this past-pandemic world and its contrasting cast of characters feel so believable and credible that really makes The Last of Us stand out from its peers.|The Last of Us brings you into a world where people die without grace, and explains to you the beauty of the extinction. It's strong, unique, brutal and, ultimately, unforgettable.|Terror and beauty are potent bedfellows in The Last of Us, a masterwork of interactive entertainment conjured up by the master gamesmiths at Naughty Dog.|Despite a few issues, The Last of Us represents at the same time the complete maturity of the PlayStation 3 hardware and, above all, the perfect fusion between gameplay and narrative. Naughty Dog has created a masterpiece that will be a milestone in the video games evolution.|I do not know if The Last of Us is the best game of this generation, given that it always depends on what you’re looking for in a game, but it's a true example of how to create a credible world with authentic characters in which we end up investing a lot emotionally.|I was transfixed by the game, truly loved playing it.  It is definitely my game of the year, if not my game of the PS3.  That said, there were some very, VERY minor things that irritated me.|Something that plays well, makes you think, and keeps you playing to the end is, without a doubt, worth taking in.|The comparisons to Uncharted can’t be ignored and, while it might appear a ‘safe move’ by Naughty Dog on the surface, their new franchise undoubtedly pushes the boundaries in a welcome new direction. They have put their well-polished engine to excellent use and put the emphasis on compelling characters to showcase what this talented studio can really deliver.|The writing is great, the acting is superb, the characters are beautifully designed and developed, there’s a riveting sense of authenticity, and the immersion one feels is unmatched.|This is the most ambitious project Naughty Dog has made so far. It's not a new genre, but it mixes up some of them to bring something unique. It's got nothing to do with Uncharted apart from the look some images may show, but still is one of the best games on PlayStation 3.|Flawless in its ambition and almost perfect in its execution. A brave and remarkable game quite unlike any other.|Plenty of action and horror, Naughty Dog's post-apocalyptic tale is an amazing game.|The Last of Us is a really different game, mixing traditional adventure, survival, action, stealth and constant exploration. The resources are most important. The best graphics on PlayStation 3 are back in the hands of Naughty Dog, also the atmosphere, and two unrepeatable and unforgettable characters. Overwhelming.|The Last of Us is a step forward for Naughty Dog in terms of narration, story and gameplay, maybe the last big shot for PlayStation 3 and a fine example of a ""cinematic game"" melted into a great gameplay. A must buy for every serious gamer.|It is a deeply emotional story driven game with an addictive element making it difficult to put the controller down. It is game you won’t forget and one that ultimately raises the bar for the genre.  In the end it’s simply a fantastic game, a fantastic experience, and one PS3 owners can purchase with confidence.|Three words: go get it.|If you have a PlayStation 3 there is no reason why you shouldn't buy this game (unless you are not old enough of course). The story is incredible, the gameplay is fun, and the graphics and sound are amazing. Naughty Dog had a lot to live up to with the release, but they have delivered in spades. I just hope we don't have to wait too long for a sequel. This game is everything you were hoping for, and more. Go get it!|Thrilling survival horror with brutal combat, rich characters and stunning environments. [Aug 2013, p.57]|Much like the adventures of Drake, if you own a PS3, you need to own this game.|The Last of Us is a testament to game design. Naughty Dog continues to perfect their craft at immersive storytelling, while still delivering one amazing game to play.|The world is full of one trick AAA games, so any big title that manages to shake up the clear-cut genre barriers should be considered a welcome exception. For all intents and purposes, The Last of Us is a breakthrough title. It's enjoyable as a full-on shooter, a stealth game, an action adventure and a stat-building RPG. It's about as good as it gets for the current console generation. [June 2013]|As the credits rolled, I found myself missing my time with Joel and Ellie, yet completely comfortable with the thought that Naughty Dog has forged a new IP where there doesn’t need to be The Last of Us 2.|An absolutely stunning game that only minors and the squeamish should avoid, The Last of Us will rightly be remembered as one of this generation's very best games.|The Last of Us offers a bitter and horrifying look at humanity after a ‘zombie apocalypse’. It's an emotional journey that’ll touch you, without a doubt. But it doesn’t only have a strong story: the constant tension, great gameplay scenario’s and atmosphere make for a brilliant combination of elements that I can easily recommend to any gamer.|With The Last of Us developer Naughty Dog switches from the easy entertainment that is Uncharted, to the more serious stuff. Despite their differences, both games prove to be of unprecedented high levels of quality, from a studio that controls their ability to create games into the smallest detail. Thanks to its unique pace and adult story The Last of Us has become an experience that has no equal.|The Last of Us spells the magnum opus for Naughty Dog on the PlayStation 3, offering us a unique experience that easily eclipses anything else we’ve seen on the system. This game is easily a contender for adventure game of the year.|Hopefully not the last great game of this generation, but definitely one of the best of them. Nobody should miss out on this jaw-dropping masterpiece of epic proportions.|Naughty Dog puts an end to the current generation with a game that explores the human interaction of two characters, Joel and Ellie, that are destined to get along in a shattered world that has been wonderfully represented thanks to its impressive technical aspects. The Last of Us, in spite of its small imperfections, is an adult title that no PS3 player should let go unplayed.|With The Last of Us, Naughty Dog provides us with a hell of a masterpiece, which will continue to occupy the thoughts of gamers in the coming years, simply because it redefines the standards of survival Horror games. Instead of using and abusing horrific scenes as is the case with the competitors, the game provides a chronic stress that chews on your brains bit by bit punctuated by great epic scenes. The infected people are relentless and unforgiving, though a bit like the Clickers who will rip your head at the slightest sound. The listening system does not impact the challenge and finds itself an invaluable asset when things get really dirty. As one needs to seduce casual gamers, The Last of Us also has its own action scenes, hence the criticism from the purists of this kind of game. But can we really be skeptical when facing the nicest game of this generation of consoles ? No, we cant...|It’s easy to initially expect The Last of Us to be a game about killing zombies, surviving in a post-apocalyptic world, and exploring for supplies. Instead, it’s a game about two people, and the bond that forms between them—and that journey is far more exciting than any amount of infected monsters or food scavenging could ever provide.|The Last of Us is a deeply felt, shockingly violent game that questions what we're willing to sacrifice and, more disturbingly, what we're willing to do so save the ones we love. The conclusion offers no easy answers. You won't forget it.|A thrilling, cinematic, movie-like action-adventure with the best videogame pairing ever conceived.|It will live with us. Here, finally, is a videogame that will live with us. There are inconsistencies here and there, some lulls in its gameplay, but when The Last Of Us is good (winter), it's better than anything else this gen - we do not say that lightly. [Issue#232, p.62]|The Last of Us is a must-play title for any PS3 owner who's not squeamish about violence and depressing subject matter. It has flaws, but they don't detract from the overall experience, and at worst, the game could use a little more interaction.|Quotation forthcoming.|Despite the breakneck pace of the prologue, it takes quite a while for The Last of Us to pick up some speed again. However, once the cold harsh winter arrives, the action (and story) ramps up. So much so, it puts most Hollywood productions to shame. [July 2013, p.76]|The Last of Us merges very good gameplay with a peerless story and unequaled production values. While it just misses transcendent status you won't find very many games that are more worth the investment of your time.|As someone who was never a great fan of Uncharted or Jak and Daxter, I am genuinely amazed at how much I liked this game. If this isn't art, then I don't know what is. [Aug 2013, p.59]|With a well-thought-out mythos, a mildly original take on the zombie survival game that relies more on superb execution and storytelling than innovative mechanics, acting that's so good we actually see character development happen without even words being spoken, and Naughty Dog's impressive engine and top-notch production values, it all comes together to make for a wonderful reminder that not all big-budget action games need to be measured in headshots-per-minute.|Like the fungus that infected its deformed inhabitants, The Last of Us is not an enjoyable thing to experience. It’s depressing, exhausting and even disturbing. But , contrary to everything I tell myself, it’s something I won’t soon forget.|It feels like an important evolutionary step in presentation and tone, presenting a believable narrative populated with realistic characters, structured in a way that remains captivating until the last word is spoken. Multiplayer is disposable and combat can feel a bit rudimentary at times complete with balance issues, but being perpetually enveloped in the stunning world Naughty Dog created makes it easy to forget any flaws.|The Last of Us is an excellent action adventure game with superb graphics and audio and really great characters. The game shows us a quite realistic vision of a cataclysmic future, and at the same time is a very good shooter mixed with high quality stealth game. The Last of Us is a linear adventure, but this is a good kind of ""corridor"" story that offers some freedom and doesn't limit your imagination. What is more, it's one of the most mature games in history.|In the developer of The Last of Us, Naughty Dog, we find the king of action-adventurers more and more. Its last game brings us storytelling that is as endearing and emotional as it gets. A definite must-play for every gamer worldwide.|The characters in The Last of Us are relatable without being entirely stereotypical, the story is driven by the characters, rather than the reverse, and the adventure sections, while nothing new mechanically, offer a great way to really delve into the world. Given the lack of truly innovative mechanics, and the reliance on well-known types of gameplay, like the all-too-typical ""find a ladder to climb to the next section"" adventuring bits, The Last of Us isn't perfect, but it's awfully close.|A stunning achievement in both storytelling and third person adventure, with unforgettable characters and tense, brilliantly paced action.|Naughty Dog managed to create a different kind of action game, one with a more dramatic, desperate and authentic tone than Uncharted. Joel and Ellie offer you a journey you won't forget, just bring lots of bullets and keep your head down.|The Last of Us has perhaps the best artificial intelligence I’ve ever seen in a game. The enemies, whether they are mindless zombies or clever human ""hunters,"" behave in amazingly realistic ways, forcing the player to think up equally smart strategies in each encounter.|It’s the relationships that really make The Last Of Us. It’s a technical marvel, a true triple-A with best-in-show production values, but it’s the beautiful combination of performance and story that elevates it clearly above the competition.|The pacing becomes somewhat sluggish right before you hit the final act, but from there it moves at a 100 miles an hour. I didn’t leave my couch until well after the credits rolled.|Naughty Dog has created a exciting and emotional adventure, packed with a great cast of characters, impressive voice acting and beautiful visuals. A varied selection of enemies offers a diverse challenge, and you often have to change strategies to get by without using up your resources. The multiplayer is functional and well done, but is eclipsed by the amazing single player adventure.|The Last of Us is a stable and very decent action game, wrapped in an absolutely incredible presentation and story. When it comes to the narrative, The Last of Us sets a new golden standard that every game will be compared to for years to comes. It honestly feels as if Naughty Dog has raised the bar of what games as a medium are able to achieve in this area, and makes franchises like Call of Duty and all its wannabes seem decidedly laughable.|The Last of Us delights with its artistic side but can tire you with its gameplay. It tells an interesting story but doesn’t leave much room for the player. It represents a new quality in the industry but openly borrows a lot of themes from literature, movies and other games. The most important thing however is the fact that several days after I finished The Last of Us, it is still in my head, causing strange uneasiness. I guess that’s what the developers were aiming for. [CD-Action 08/2013, p.62]|A brilliant and evocative story, superb combat mechanics and an interesting multiplayer component, The Last Of Us is one of this generation's best.|The Last of Us is a great action-adventure game that manages to
capture the feeling of post-apocalypse and survival. The story is
alright but way too manipulative and borrows heavily from other,
better, material. Still the segmented survival gameplay and the
amazing audiovisual production makes the game an experience everybody
should check out.|I'd say that the kind of story that The Last of Us wants to tell can't be done in a mainstream video game, but I Am Alive and the Metro series manage just fine. Perhaps it's more accurate to say that it can't be done in the kind of game that's expected to sell three million copies.|Despite its major victories and steps forward in storytelling, many of those same annoying video game conventions — the demand for action and high body counts, the lack of truly engaging and innovative play mechanics — continue to pull games like The Last of Us down toward the lowest common denominator.|Despite the many small problems in combat, there's an undeniable tension. Vanquishing a horde of attackers is challenging, so you must fight intelligently.|Despite the occasional jarring juxtaposition between its story and its gameplay, The Last of Us is a landmark piece of interactive entertainment, proving that even action games can tell mature, thoughtful tales, with characters who don’t feel like an assortment of tropes and clichés.|The amazing art direction and style are on double duty in The Last of Us, because the game’s designers did not think its universe through. Yes, monsters are not the focal point of this story, but only three types is too few for a campaign spanning 12 to 15 hours. There are also human bandits, but a few encounters – and you’ve seen them all.|Naughty Dog commits to a somber tone that affects every piece of the game for better and worse. It achieves incredible emotional high points about as often as it bumps up against tired scenario design that doesn't fit its world. Survival in the post-apocalypse requires compromise, but The Last of Us has given up something vital.|There is no risk of failure in a game like this. There is only the risk of having the play the same section yet again. In a survival game, that’s anathema. A survival game without meaningful death isn’t a survival game. It’s just a game.|"

I|Ultimately, Infinite will linger in your memory for a long time after the credits have rolled. Irrational Games, through its own turmoil of lead staff departing, a multiplayer mode that started late in the piece only to be canned (a wise move) have proved that excellence takes time. This is a genre-defining game, and it deserves to be played by anyone who’s ready for a brilliant story, engaging gun-play and a real challenge. [May 2013, p68]|If you’re reading this review because you have never played a Bioshock title before or didn’t like the previous games but like the look of this one, then please, go play it. I am certain you won’t be disappointed.|As near perfect as a game can get and should not be missed.|While it was a risk to move away from the depths of Rapture and into the clouds of Columbia, Irrational Games has once again crafted a dazzling new world, which succeeds in taking the franchise to stunning new heights.|Aside from some superficial issues, there’s really nothing wrong with the game at all – it’s better than BioShock ever was; it’s fully realised and complete. It’s so, so near perfect and the first words Booker hear when he steps into the land of Columbia reflect my thoughts entirely: “It’s heaven – or as close as we’ll see until judgement day.”|BioShock Infinite is state of the of art. Irrational Games exceeds expectations and revolutionizes the FPS genre with an exceptionally outstanding story and gameplay. Definitely one of the best games of the generation.|If Half-Life and the original Deus Ex stand as the apotheosis of the narrative-driven shooter, and Bioshock brought the genre to PS3, then Infinite is the latest game to join these hallowed ranks. This is a masterpiece that will be discussed for years to come, and praise doesn’t come much higher than that.|My favorite aspect of Infinite is the one about which I can say the least: story. The build-up is slow, but it works wonderfully thanks to the small ways other elements flow into the narrative.|One of those rare games that speaks to the player on a personal, emotional level with a thought-provoking, mature storyline set in one of the most amazing worlds conceived in a game. Plus, it's a wonderful FPS with deep, tactical combat. Essential. [Issue#230, p.66]|An immensely creative triumph. At various times during this adventure, you will experience completely different emotions and you will face distinctly different situations. In addition to this fantastic variety and diversity, you get a story that is mysterious and satisfying on all counts. Factor in rock solid control, unbelievable design from top to bottom, the joy of powerful experimentation, and an unparalleled atmosphere, and you’ve got one mammoth achievement.|Irrational Games did the impossible. They've created a world that rivals Rapture and built a story around it that is bound to intrigue everyone who picks this game up. The ending is an instant classic. The gameplay is challenging and varied, the graphics are fine (not perfect though) and both voice acting and soundtrack is extremely memorable. Buy this, you absolutely won't regret it.|Irrational Games have found the perfect formula for Bioshock Infinite, almost flawless gameplay, graphics and sound plus a mysterious story about a broken city of gold but where the game goes beyond its predecessors is with the inclusion of one of the most realistic AI characters to have ever graced a game.|BioShock Infinite is a master class in storytelling. With exceedingly fun gameplay and combat, a beautifully intriguing world to explore, and an extremely impressive cast of characters, BioShock Infinite stands as one of the best first-person shooters ever made.|With BioShock Infinite, Irrational Games shows how to really tell a story in a video game. But not only is the story amazing, the combat is more fluid and dynamic than its predecessors, and Columbia is a place that begs to be explored. BioShock Infinite offers a journey that every gamer needs to experience.|A narrative masterpiece that heavily improves on the gameplay of its predecessors and springs the genre forward. Columbia has done the impossible: it surpasses Rapture.|BioShock: Infinite is a marvelous masterpiece, a must have, a unique and beautiful game and maybe the best game of recent years. Everything about this game just makes sense. It offers a beautiful world, a good balance between action, exploration and story. And my god, what a story! Do yourself a favor and get this game as soon as you can, because this is a title that will be spoken of for a good while to come.|Infinite comes through as a true, worthy follow-up to BioShock, one of the most-renowned shooters of this generation. In my book, it becomes one itself.|In an infinite universe, anything can happen, but in Infinite's, the specifics are what get you.|BioShock Infinite is a sublime shooter set in a magical world. While the campaign’s final third never quite lives up to its breathtaking opening, there’s more than enough intrigue imprisoned within Columbia’s curious suspended districts to keep you compelled from the beginning right through to the very end.|Columbia is a unique and unforgettable city meant to inspire its inhabitants — both virtual and player-controlled — to gaze in awe, shock, and horror at its bountiful marvels...So long as you remember to stop snooping through rubbish bins and take time to pause and look around, I have no doubt you’ll be properly amazed.|All told, BioShock Infinite is among the rarest of games that is a ton of fun to play, yet also one that asks players to think beyond the action. The only thing keeping me from giving it a perfect score is my own personal cynicism that the deep message it claims to have might not actually be there – it’s a question I’ll only be able to answer after multiple play-throughs.|Bioshock is an experience that every gamer in the World should have. Irrational Games did a great job, not making the ""perfect game"" but one that could leave a mark in video games history.|A stupendous game, portraying a beautiful and broken city that will absorb your every waking thought.|Daringly ambitious in terms of both subject matter and structure, BioShock Infinite is the most successful mix of storytelling and action this generation of gaming has ever seen.|Multiple dimensions and a clever scenario with a surprise around every corner make it difficult for us to explain our enthusiasm without spoiling the story. Only the extended ghost chase (literally) halfway through the game drags on a bit too long. [April 2013, p.74]|The plot and combat could’ve been better, but its mode of storytelling demands your attention nonetheless as there’s no other experience like it and, for a good many, that means a lot of return trips to come."

I'm running out of superlatives here, so let me finish where I started: Go play it.|Super Mario 3D World can be easily summarised — it’s a terrifically enjoyable, tight and impeccably structured experience. It recalls the mascot’s 3D heritage while providing the perfect starting point for those that prefer 2D platforming, catering to an audience of beginners and skilled veterans alike. Nintendo’s also mastered Mario multiplayer for, arguably, the first time; it’s still manic and can be either co-operative or competitive, but there’s also a sense of space that allows determined groups to progress coherently.|Thankfully 3D World isn’t just a refinement of the Mario formula, it’s a powerful re-imagining.

It takes the core elements that fans know and love from Nintendo's long-standing series, and mixes it smoothly in with gorgeous open-world exploration of Xenoblade Chronicles, to craft something so breath-taking and absorbing that hours upon hours will pass by without notice, and barely any progress will have actually been made in the main story because there were so many other aspects to take in and play around with, as well as sub-missions that fit so naturally into the core quest. Nintendo has outdone itself with The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - absolutely sublime work.|A titanic open world full of life and things to do, a robust combat system, the best story ever to grace the series, an unprecedented artistic direction, puzzles that will blow your mind...are only some of the elements that make The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild an authentic masterpiece that will leave a mark on this medium forever.|It's one of the best video games I've ever played, and is sure to keep you busy for many hours, days and weeks, exploring this vast, beautiful, unexpected world.|The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is no mere Zelda game — it is a return to form for the decades-old series, showing that Nintendo still very much understands how to handle their property.

It is an absolutely extraordinary game, one that is a fitting end to the Wii U and glorious beginning for the Switch.|Breath of the Wild’s only tangible constraint is how creative the player can be at any given moment. The game is genuinely challenging, with secrets and rewards to be found around every corner. As you play, the staggering amount of ways in which you can interact with Hyrule naturally reveal themselves. There is always something new to discover, but at your own pace. Somehow, the adventure never loses momentum over dozens of hours of exploration, the inspired design holds up, making for an unmistakable Zelda game that completely changes everything expected from the series. After spending so much time with Breath of the Wild, it is already hard to imagine going back to the antiquated presentation of the past.|If there’s a better game out there than Breath of the Wild, I haven’t played it. Nintendo has created, for me, the greatest game of all time. It’s everything I want from a game and one of the most rewarding experiences I’ve ever had.|I think the result of all of its interlocking systems is a game that wants to slam you with moments of epiphanies. For me, my experience with Link’s Awakening was about getting that one major flash of insight and then using that to understand the rest of the game and then the rest of the Zelda series. For Breath of the Wild, Nintendo made a game that could replicate that moment over and over.|The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is Nintendo firing on all cylinders. It's not just the best Zelda game yet, it's quite possibly the best game Nintendo has ever produced and is nothing short of a masterpiece.|Having played numerous RPGs over many years, it’s tough to think of one that is as spellbinding and so moreish as this. A modern day marvel on the Nintendo Switch, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is simply stunning.|It is dense yet lean; its maps bursting with distraction but without an inch of it wasted. It is classical yet modern; drawing on the heritage of its own illustrious series while openly embracing more recent gaming trends. It is challenging yet welcoming; giving you the choice to ease yourself in or take on some of the game’s most fearsome creatures...These are just some of the reasons why, after several dozen hours of play and despite not yet seeing its quest to completion, I am convinced that it is one of the very finest video games ever made.|In reinvigorating the Zelda series, Nintendo has rediscovered what gave it life all those years ago, capturing a spirit of adventure that flows through Breath of the Wild like the breeze on Hyrule's fields.

Nintendo has crafted a wide, beautiful world to explore, underpinned with some interesting emergent mechanics. Breath of the Wild stands as one of the best in the series and a great opener for Nintendo's newest console.|Breath of the Wild isn’t just for longstanding Zelda fans, it’s the pinnacle of an open-world experience that will appeal to anyone looking for a great game. An overall lack of voiced dialogue and an initially tricky menu layout are easy to come to terms with and overlook when compared to the sheer scale and fun found in Breath of the Wild. Anyone wondering how it stacks up, it’s important to note that this could very well be the best Zelda has ever been, and it provides gamers of all walks with a Hyrule that’s more than worth saving.|I’ve mentioned Ocarina of Time a few times, and there’s a reason – it is the benchmark by which all other Zelda games are tested. Somehow, and beyond all of my expectations, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild exceeds that mark. I can confidently declare that Breath of the Wild is the best Zelda game ever made.|This sense of wonder is something that I haven’t felt so strongly since I played A Link to the Past when I was seven years old. Ocarina of Time was able to capture some of that same magic in my teenage years. Now that I’m in my thirties, I don’t think that I expected it to be possible for a game to make me feel like that again.|A game that marries the best bits of the franchise’s long history with the best bits of the rest of the gaming world, and produces something even greater than the sum of its parts.|I was entranced by this version of Hyrule, and it surprised me at nearly every turn, from its wealth of discoveries to the way it shuns the established tropes of previous Zelda games. It represents a profound new direction for one of gaming’s best franchises and a new high point for open-world interactive experiences.|I guess, in the end, it’s not just that Breath of the Wild signals that Zelda has finally evolved and moved beyond the structure it’s leaned on for so long. It’s that the evolution in question has required Nintendo to finally treat its audience like intelligent people. That newfound respect has led to something big, and different, and exciting. But in an open world full of big changes, Breath of the Wild also almost always feels like a Zelda game — and establishes itself as the first current, vital-feeling Zelda in almost 20 years.|The most freeform Zelda yet, without sacrificing the charm, fun or quality you expect from the series. Nintendo’s finest work since Super Mario Galaxy.|This is the most special game Nintendo has made in years - especially for the core game playing audience.

It is a new all-time classic.|The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a landmark release for its franchise and Nintendo. It's the first time that Nintendo has truly taken on the open-world genre in a current-generation sense; in arriving late to the party, though, it embraces some strengths from top-of-the-class games while also forging its own identity. This game is a revolution for the franchise, but the Legend of Zelda essence is still there - its soul remains. The end result, then, is a captivating experience. This will be in the running as the best game in the IP's history, and it will likely be discussed as a leading contender in the broader open-world genre. Nintendo has bravely taken one of its biggest franchises in a new direction, and it's delivered a triumph.|Breath of the Wild writes a new chapter in the videogames industry. Nintendo jumps to the open world scenario with passion to renew all the things we know about Zelda.

It presents a wonderful sandbox full of mystery, dangling dozens upon dozens of tantalizing things in front of you that just beg to be explored. I’ve had so many adventures in Breath of the Wild, and each one has a unique story behind what led me to them, making them stories on top of stories. And even after I’ve spent more than 50 hours searching the far reaches of Hyrule, I still manage to come across things I haven’t seen before. I’ll easily spend 50 to 100 more trying to track down its fascinating moments.|The best Zelda there’s ever been, and very possibly the best video game ever made.|Breath of the Wild is The Legend of Zelda game I didn’t know I always wanted until I starting playing. It’s a disservice to simply label it spectacular, and “must buy” as a Switch launch title is merely a formality. Nintendo promised a lot and left us hanging delay after delay, culminating in a cross-gen switch, but it’s delivered in every sense of the word. Breath of the Wild is the best in a series that’s almost never disappointed.|It's like nothing else Nintendo has made, an experience so simultaneously prodigious and accomplished that it feels like a mind-blowing mic drop to the sort of ""open world"" games (Grand Theft Auto V, The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim, The Witcher 3) the industry seems bent on proliferating.|The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is one of the best games ever made.|This isn't your typical boiler plate open world cash grab, rife with to-do lists and busywork. Zelda: Breath of the Wild is an evolution of the formula for both eastern and western philosophies alike, and a new blueprint.|The result, for all the longevity of its series and the familiarity of the open-world genre, is a game that evokes feelings we haven’t known for 20 years. Not since Ocarina Of Time have we set foot in a world that seems so mind-bogglingly vast, that feels so unerringly magical, that proves so relentlessly intriguing. Plenty of games promise to let us go anywhere and do anything; few, if any, ever deliver on it so irresistibly. Nineteen years on, Ocarina is still held up as the high-water mark of one of gaming’s best-loved – and greatest – series. Now it may have to settle for second place. [April 2017, p.104]|The experience is so phenomenal, it deserves to be in the conversation about the best Zelda game of all-time, if not the best games of all-time.

[Apr 2017, p.60]|While other open world games offer a path you may stray from only slightly, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild offers a path that is as wide and far-reaching as the eye can see.

Nintendo have captured the sense of wonder, danger, and awe that they created in 1986, and embedded it in a vast, enthralling world.|In spite of all the strong framerate dips, and poor textures, Zelda: Breath of the Wild is simply the best game of the IP.

With a stunningly beautiful and interactive world, surprising difficulty, and a dizzying amount of riddles and puzzles, there’s no end to the secrets hidden in the vast land of Hyrule.|The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a culmination of every small step Nintendo’s made with the series resulting in one of the most satisfying games I’ve ever played.|It’s been worth the wait.

[Issue#218, p.72]|For any gamer that views Ocarina of Time as the highlight of the franchise, Breath of the Wild is a very pleasant surprise. The innovations Nintendo offers are -nearly all- amazing and Hyrule is more appealing and grandiose than ever before.|This is the best Legend of Zelda since Ocarina of Time. While Nintendo might not be the ingenious pioneer of the 80s and 90s, they prove, that they are willing to evolve and are still able to set a creative mark. With its towers, the loot and the collecting appeal it can’t deny its ingratiation to the zeitgeist, but most of the time Nintendo does it better and more subtle than the competition.|Breath Of The Wild delivers a huge world, and one that is interesting to explore even when such escapades prove fruitless. It comes good with satisfying combat and dozens of reasons to carry on playing after the credits. For all of its issues, it’s a game that manages to reinvent itself, comfortably, effortlessly, in a space dominated by the industry’s triple-A heavyweights. This is one of the most creative and engrossing open-world games in quite some time.|However you characterize it -- rebirth, change of direction, or coming of age -- The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is the most mature game in the series' long history. It is a difficult game from a combat and survival perspective, and a challenging game in the amount of information that players have been trusted to figure out for themselves. Compared to its amazingly interactive and constantly surprising world, Breath of the Wild's relatively rote story and sometimes frustrating controls add a note of disappointment to an otherwise peak gaming experience.|Whether new to the series or a long time veteran, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is the perfect balance of challenge, adventure and fun that shouldn’t be missed out on.|There is almost nothing without purpose in Breath of the Wild’s world and it is easy to get lost for hours on end without ever advancing the story.

It suffers technical limitations compared to other open-world games on other consoles... of course. But this new adventure is absolutely fantastic though, and it's actually one of the best in the series.|Nintendo has achieved something really special with Breath of the Wild. All that’s holding it back are the glaring framerate issues, but even that’s not enough to dim the greatness that shines through. After trying for nearly a decade, the Zelda team has finally made a radical departure from the established Zelda formula. This is a bold new direction for the series, one that so perfectly embraces the spirit of the original NES adventure and re-imagines it for a new generation.

It's a brave new step into uncharted territory that continues to offer surprises and challenges long into its massive running time.

It’s nice to see that even after all these years, Hyrule still has plenty of magic left in it.|At its absolute best, Breath of the Wild offers some of the most absorbing experiences a Zelda game ever has. Unfortunately, it makes you work harder for it than you should, buried as it is under a pile of small but constant irritations that collaborate to form a thick crust of frustration around a delectable center. Breath of the Wild is a delightful adventure, one that tries its utmost to be as big a pain in the arse as possible.|The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild surprises with its gorgeous visual effects, spectacular horizons and the vast freedom given to players.

Breath of the Wild is an instant classic and a brave new direction for a series that has been stuck in some of its ways for far too long.|It's hard to overstate the courage and conviction with which producer Eiji Aonuma, director Hidemaro Fujibayashi and their team have rewritten their own work, and the size of the risk Nintendo has taken with a beloved property. Breath of the Wild isn't just the most radical departure from the Zelda tradition in its 30-year history, it's the first Nintendo game that feels like it was made in a world where Half-Life 2, Halo, Grand Theft Auto 3 and Skyrim happened. It's inspired by those greats and others, but it doesn't ape them any more than it rests on its own laurels. [Essential]|In this modern age of objective-laden open worlds, convoluted skill trees and tiresome hand-holding, that sense of real adventure – that you might find something that no one else in the world has seen – is all too rare. And a Zelda game may have been the last place in the world you expected to find it.|This is a game that will dominate dinner conversations. It’s a game that will lead to countless anecdotes, discoveries, and swapped stories. Already, colleagues and I have spent a great deal of time comparing notes and talking about how we solved major puzzles.|That's what makes this Zelda so special. For all that's familiar in the world and its inhabitants, the mechanics and the abilities they empower, there's one critical difference: Breath of the Wild sets you free. We've marched off to free Hyrule from Ganon's clutches time and time again, but this is the first Zelda game in which you can really, truly lose yourself.|Breath of the Wild has something that’s been missing from the series for years: surprise. Most recent Zelda adventures have become formulaic, abiding by a rigid and proven structure that offers nostalgia and familiarity, but little room for revelations, either big or small. Breath of the Wild is more open and natural than its predecessors, letting you discover things — like how lightning works — through experimentation. It isn’t always as curated and cinematic as other Zelda games, but the unpredictability makes it feel like a true adventure, where you’re uncovering your own path, instead of hitting your marks and following the script.|In marketing material, Nintendo has been calling this game an ""open air adventure,"" the sort of unique genre description that is invented alongside so many big budget Japanese games. When I first heard that term, I rolled my eyes a little. The power of the term ""adventure"" has been diminished through use in the games industry. A term that once conjured a feeling of momentum and danger, intrigue and bravery has become generic. But Breath of the Wild managed to revive the term for me. For the first time in years, I don't just feel like I'm fighting enemies or searching for loot, like I'm ""questing"" or ""exploring."" I feel like I'm adventuring.|It’s scale is unprecedented for a Zelda game, and it encourages you to move slowly. I want to honor that. And while I fear that the sheer breadth of the experience might ultimately push some players away, I’m relishing my time spent in this hushed, half-dead Hyrule. After thirty years of The Legend of Zelda, I’m delighted that the series has finally lost its way again."

This is another Mario game that will be remembered for ages to come.|Super Mario Odyssey’s unabashed sense of whimsy and charm is all too welcome in today’s modern video game climate. Whereas other titles feel the need to overbear you with endless things to do, people to kill and towers to climb, Mario’s latest globe-trotting adventure is all too happy to keep things simple — and in the most imaginative way possible.

Great gameplay mechanics, an outstanding number of worlds and amazing graphics are the ingredients of this masterpiece.|Each kingdom is absolutely packed with charm, clever objectives, gorgeous visuals, a stellar soundtrack, and a huge variety of ways to have fun. One moon would have me leaping across tiny platforms with pinpoint precision, and the next would have me cheering up a businessman by dressing like a clown. At no point did I feel like I was checking boxes just to up my completion percentage. Even now that I've collected every moon and purple coin in the game, I still want to play more of it. It’s one of the most joyous and entertaining gaming experiences I’ve had in a long time, and it stands tall among the all-time great Mario games.|It's extraordinary, really, that after all this time a new Mario game can feel as fresh as any that preceded it. Cappy is a revelation, exploring Kingdoms is bliss, and Super Mario Odyssey is a masterpiece.|While I may be far removed from the days spent playing Super Mario World as a kid, completing it for the umpteenth time and still finding new secrets with each playthrough, experiencing Super Mario Odyssey transported me back to that same sense of wonder I felt when I first discovered the Star World, or when I used my cape to accidentally stumble upon a secret key that opened up a brand new level. Nintendo has delivered everything I could want in a Mario game, before adding things that I didn't even know I wanted. The end result of their efforts is a true modern masterpiece.|Super Mario Odyssey honors much of what makes other 3D Mario games great, plus it adds plenty of its own flavor to the Mario stew thanks to its capture mechanic. Mario Odyssey can keep you busy for hours and hours if you want it to, and you probably will. Outside of a few instances where the camera took on a mind of its own, I can't think of a moment when I wasn't enjoying myself while journeying with Mario and Cappy.|Super Mario Odyssey successfully brings the series up to date and opens it up to a new audience, while still retaining every ounce of its nostalgia and retro charm.|In almost every way, the game acts as a love letter to fans of the 3D iterations of the Super Mario franchise. From the spectacular Kingdoms and all of their hidden secrets to the minute nods to past ventures and friends, the entirety of this adventure is a joyride from beginning to end – with countless hours that can be invested into the title long after the narrative has been completed. The formulaic changes have helped modernized a genre that has long been dormant, which is an immense feat in and of itself.|New sidekick Cappy could have been just another annoying sidekick, but its inclusion only adds to the playfulness of Nintendo Switch’s first Mario adventure.|Mario’s games have been around for almost as long as game consoles have been a thing, but thankfully, he’s always evolving. We rarely get the same Mario twice.

The Nintendo Switch is fast becoming the hottest platform, crammed full of sublime quality gaming experiences like this fantastic new escapade.|By jumping aboard the Odyssey, Mario takes us on a trip where await nothing but discoveries and wonders all along. By gathering elements from every game of the franchise, Nintendo expand the classic gameplay with Cappy's possession. Diverse, intelligent, colorful and incredibly long and surprising, the free exploration will satisfy both curious and hardcore gamers. Super Mario Odyssey sanctifies a 30-year-old series that still amazes us episode after episode.|As someone who enjoys level-based Super Mario games more, I have to say that Odyssey blew me away. With the next Power Moon constantly within reach, the push forward is constant. Using Mario's expanded moveset, unique challenges are abound while trying to collect your next Power Moon. Even the lack of traditional power-ups doesn’t hurt the experience at all, as the team of Mario and Cappy offers all sorts of wonderful new abilities. The journey of this odyssey took me to all sorts of amazing worlds that I already find myself missing. Now that I've seen every bit of it, I look back on my adventure with a great smile. It is an incredible experience that I felt extremely compelled to complete, simply because I didn't want it all to end. Only the best games pull that feeling out of me, and this one did just that.

It isn’t just a masterclass of level and sound design, it’s a celebration of the Super Mario franchise, and one of helluva celebration to take part in.|Super Mario Odyssey represents a shift in direction for Mario. For about a decade we had exceptional but tightly structured 3D series entries, but this new arrival's building blocks go back to Super Mario 64. It's a very modern take on 'sandbox Mario', however - Cappy and his abilities are key additions that freshen up the formula, and we have a sizeable and diverse set of lands to explore. Odyssey will, inevitably, now enter the discussions about the 'best' Mario games. This writer won't be crowning it as number one just yet, but it is nevertheless worthy of the discussion. Particularly in the second half and post-credits it takes on a life of its own, showcasing incredible design and development flair. It's also a wonderful showcase for the Switch, and could introduce a whole new audience to the wonders of Mario in three dimensions. For the veterans among us, it's yet another special release to remind us of why Mario is still gaming's number one.|Not since Super Mario 64 has a Mario adventure had me this captivated, immersed or impressed. Super Mario Odyssey is Nintendo's finest Super Mario title yet, and easily the most impressive Nintendo Switch title available. With so much to see and do - long after you've dispatched Bowser - you'll be returning to the Odyssey for a long time. Essential for all Switch owners and worth buying a Switch for. It's that good. [Issue 9, Page 16]|The pleasure of Super Mario Odyssey comes in the constant promise of something new. It is, in many ways, the greatest digital holiday you will ever take. An idea that Nintendo is very much aware of with the ever expanding wardrobe of travelling outfits, detailed maps for each Kingdom laid out like travel brochures and souvenirs that you can buy up with stage-specific coins. The variety, invention and sheer generosity on each trip is bewildering, an affirmation that Nintendo in this kind of exuberant form are absolutely peerless. A trip to savour. And not a second wasted.|Super Mario Odyssey is bursting at the seams with creativity, as Nintendo plays with new ideas while also paying homage to their long history. Cappy's abilities are a perfect compliment to Mario's own, and there's a wonderful silliness and humour to their adventure as they visit a string of contrasting kingdoms that just beg you to find the secrets hidden around every corner. Simply put, Super Mario Odyssey is a masterpiece.|Nintendo has managed, not once, but twice now in 2017 to take one of their beloved franchises, give it a breath of fresh air while still retaining the core of what made the series great in the first time.

Maybe I’ll revisit the wonder of the Cascade Kingdom and ride a Tyrannosaurus Rex. I could even play fetch with a shiba inu amongst the sand dunes, or bust out Mario’s infamous swimsuit and test my skills against an ornery octopus thirsty for revenge. The best part of getting to the game’s ending is the fact that it’s a journey of your own creation, and if you reflect on the game as a whole, it’s really a linear quest that somehow feels more freeing than the largest open-world game.|A mix of the nostalgic, the fantastical, and the wonderfully bizarre, Mario's latest adventure provides more than a dozen tantalizing playgrounds to explore.

It looks, sounds and plays just as great as expected, but the collection of power moons can sometimes feel a bit like a chore.|Though a really neat game, Super Mario Odyssey is an utterly underwhelming adventure for every long-term Super Mario fan in existence. Unless Cappy brainwashed you. In that case, you are a satisfied zombie customer now.

[Essential]|Odyssey is a playground of action game types, an endless buffet at the good kind of Sizzler, the one with the chicken wings and the cheese toast. It doesn’t allow you to get too reliant on any one set of moves, as another one is often available nearby.|It’s a pristine combination of all the directions this company has taken its icon in over the last several decades, cherry-picking the best traits from Mario’s many outings—and out into Nintendo’s wider oeuvre—and rolling them into an adventure that refuses to quit changing. This is a testament to the company’s enduring experimental nature and exacting eye for smart, intuitive game design, but after all these years of largely delivering on that reputation, could we really have expected anything less?

(The game opens up significantly after you complete the story.) There are coins and moons to collect and tucked-away nooks to discover. There are many moments in Odyssey where it doesn’t necessarily look like a Mario game, but more like the squat plumber has been transported into some other virtual realm. But it always feels like Mario — because it never stops surprising you.|As one of the best Mario games ever created, Super Mario Odyssey is one of those special circumstances where it's okay to be a child again.

Finally, the whole world will learn about the exceptionality of this series. [Issue#274]|Is there a more accomplished, accessible, brilliantly precocious example of the modern JRPG? Can’t think of one. [May 2017, p62]|It’s the sort of game that only comes around once every few years. It’s a game that is so unique in every aspect that it’d be impossible to mistake a single moment of it for anything else. It’s also a game about real life, despite the wacky hijinks you’ll often find yourself in. It’s about the moments you have with your friends, laughing around a hot pot as you make jokes only those there would understand. It’s within those moments that Persona 5 enters a league of its own, untouched by its contemporaries in every respect.|With Persona 5, Atlus has once again proven that it is the master of the modern JRPG. With terrific style, addictive gameplay, and an engaging, thought-provoking story, Persona 5 not only matches, but often exceeds its predecessors, one of which RPGamer even declared its RPG of the Decade back in 2010. It is an exceptionally long game, with most players likely to expect over one hundred hours for a single playthrough, but the investment is well worth it. Persona 5 is a remarkable game that shouldn't be missed.|I’m absolutely in love with this game, and if you haven’t given it a shot yet, I think you’ll find a lot to love about Persona 5 too. It’s not a huge departure from Persona 3 or 4, but there’s been some noticeable changes and improvements made that do make a difference, all of which are for the better. The dungeon variations, the stealth mechanics, and even the ease with which you can navigate the overworld map are noticeably better than before. So even if you’ve felt a little lukewarm about the series up until now, I’d still urge you to give Persona 5 a try.|While it’s easy to rattle off the merits of the various gameplay systems and gush about the presentation, those aren’t the things that make Persona 5 stick with you. It’s a game that’s willing to comment on the issues of today both in a broader sense and on a personal level. It doesn’t just have typical characters but rather people that you come to know by investing serious time in them. Persona 5 honors the now decades-old Shin Megami Tensei legacy without feeling content to stay within its limits, serving as a prime example of what a modern JRPG should be.|Persona 5 isn't just a rank and file member of Japan's streak of game of the year contenders in 2017, it's a blistering RPG masterpiece that cements itself among the all-time greats. Tagging along with the Phantom Thieves of Hearts on their psychedelic capers triggers a contact high of dazzling sights and sounds, with enough thematic depth to match its relentless swagger. It's a game that'll try to steal your own heart, and you'll willingly oblige.|Persona 5 is a JRPG that deserves to be played, period. There are few other games that understand their genre as well as Persona 5 does. It knows exactly what Persona fans, JRPG fans, and gamers in general want to see. It’s not just a game, it’s an addiction, and if you give it a shot you too will find yourself playing and replaying Persona 5 for the better part of 2017.|Persona 5 is a massive game. Dozens upon dozens of hours, even on the critical path, are eaten alive before you even notice it. It achieves this with a level of production that rivals even a Final Fantasy game, albeit on a wildly different plane. There are some hiccups, such as fuzzy textures (this is also on PS3, mind) and some awkward camera/movement, but as soon as the next eye-catching visual effect pops up or the next exciting cutscene with legitimately upsetting villains unravels, it’s like nothing else in your surroundings matters. Persona 5 is special, even more so for people who have been paying attention to this series for the past few decades.

I instantly felt in love with this game and I am pretty sure you will too.|Atlus has spent the last decade trying to make this niche JPRG franchise more prominent in the west, and Persona 5 deserves to be the game that finally takes the series from obscure to mainstream.

A hundred hours might not even feel like enough time; my first thought upon seeing the credits roll was “Is it too soon for New Game Plus?” Persona 5 is something very special, so never fear, JRPG fans: it was worth the wait.|With the most bewitching tale the series has ever told and an incredibly likable cast that rises above their typical archetypes, Persona 5 sings a song of rebellion.

Unless you hate RPGs, you shouldn't miss it.|Persona 5 is a massive, gorgeous JRPG with well over 100 hours of gameplay for completionists. With more to do than ever and the series’ strongest story to date, it stands out as an extraordinary, memorable experience and easily one of the deepest JRPGs of the last decade. Its sprawling dungeon design and stylish, fully realized world are an absolute joy to explore, and even after three playthroughs and the Platinum trophy, I find myself itching to go back to try different dialogue options with Confidants or revisit particularly fun puzzles.

[Apr 2017, p.66]|Persona 5 has redefined a genre of gaming and is a must-play title for every RPG gamer. Much like Persona 4 Golden was a reason to own a PSVita, Persona 5 is a reason to own a PS4.

I only hope that Atlus won't make us wait for over half a decade for the next installment in the series.|Persona 5 is proof that few titles can compare to a truly great role-playing game. Over its 60 hour playtime I got to forge meaningful friendships with an eccentric cast of characters, discover the secrets of Tokyo, and even managed to find some nice restaurants to dine at. The time investment might seem like a lot, but rarely is time wasted when spent with friends. It doesn’t reinvent the genre, as it largely builds upon Persona 4‘s stellar base, but it adds a level of polish that is simply lacking from its contemporaries.|Persona 5 delivers on its lofty promises with an emotional story, deep and innovative gameplay elements, and a unique style.

But it's only in English, which is a mayor flaw in Spain.|If the opening hours of Persona 5 are like starting a massive novel, then the closing hours are like finishing one, complete with the bittersweet finality of turning the last page. But it also carries an immense sense of satisfaction. After 100 hours of playing, all of my big questions were answered. I understood the characters, I knew my way around the world, and I had fun almost every step of the journey. You become a resident of Persona 5 the more you play it, and it has the rare ability to transport in a way few games can.|The last chapter of one of our favourite series improved over the previous chapters in every, possible way. The storyline is unique and much more consistent, and the production values (art direction, soundtrack, dubbing, graphics) are simply top-notch. The fact that the dungeons aren't randomly generated anymore is just the cherry on top.|A huge, weird, elaborate, gloomy, and thrilling masterpiece and the new king of JRPGs.|For the 20th anniversary of their role-playing saga, Atlus delivered a true masterpiece.

[06/2017, p.34]|An excellent sequel of the series that will allow you to spend a year in the skin of a high school student and during that time shape the future of the world. It offers nearly a 100 hour experience that blends JRPG with adventure, logical puzzles, and dating simulation. It entertains all the time, even though sometimes it can frustrate with its cruelty. It’s a must have for the fans of the previous games, and an ideal startup title for the newcomers.|Persona 5 is an exquisitely put together RPG overflowing with incredible style and a main cast you will sorely miss when the game is done.

If you’re a JRPG fan without a PS4, this is the game that fully justifies the purchase.|Although Persona 5 deals with the everyday angst of your average, magic-wielding teenagers, it is epic in almost every conceivable way, from its combat to its sprawling and surprise-laden story.

Persona 5 is a superb JRPG filled with social messages, great gameplay and some new ideas that take the franchise to the next level.|Persona 5 is an improvement over the last two games in almost every way.

The only drawback is the dated visuals.|As someone who has spent a lot of time with the Switch recently, and who loved the hell out of the Vita during that year or two it was getting regular games released on it, I really did find myself at times wishing this game had some kind of portable version. It just felt like the social life aspects of the game might have been more at home when I experienced them on the Vita in P4G...Still, the fact that’s my biggest complaint in 120 hours of JRPG says a lot. I was damn impressed by Persona 5, and will certainly be returning to it once I’ve had a few months to decompress from this super concise playthrough. I played 120 hours in just a couple of weeks and damn it was a lot of fun.|Persona 5 is a fantastic journey to embark on, full of well-realized characters, serviceable if a little archaic level design, and more than enough activities and distractions to keep you pushing through until its conclusion.|The focus on the rebellious, non-conformist side of youth has its drawbacks, but means Persona 5 is something to which its predecessors could never lay claim. It is, simply put, cool. Everything, from the intro movie's disco house to the battle-mode cutaways and even the basic UI, is achingly, confidently stylish.

[Essential]|So stylish...I am diggin' it. [Quick look]|For me, it has more soul, passion, humor, and panache packed into one percent of its 100-hour odyssey into thiefhood and triumph than any major release of the past year. Persona 4 brought my love of video games back from the dead. Persona 3 sustained it. And now, Persona 5 proves that it's a love still worth keeping, nearly a decade later.|This game will take many, many hours of your time. In exchange, you’ll get a terrific, pulpy story told with style to spare. Persona 5 took nearly 100 hours of my time, and I gave it gladly.|A featherweight should not be 100 hours. For all the game’s beauty and brilliance, it’s twice as long as it should be, a pompous sense of inflation that it can’t come close to fulfilling. I’d rather have bled out back in that interrogation room, a few dozen hours earlier.|For those who love the formula laid down by past games in the series, Persona 5 represents the franchise’s apex. And for newcomers, it’s a chance to enjoy one of gaming’s best treasures — with little of its baggage. It defiantly ignores the open-world trend and instead holds steadfast to the idea that a more guided, linear RPG can still work in 2017. As for me, well, the story is over. And yet, after 100 hours, I just wish I had more time.|It occupies that role of a wronged young person immaculately, giving you control of a group of teenagers who see the cruelties of adults around them with severe clarity. Then it opens a door to a supernatural world of magic and treasure, and it gives you the one thing none of us had at that age: the means to fight back.|"

This is the new benchmark by which open world games will be measured, but none will be meeting its heady heights anytime soon.|Red Dead Redemption 2 raises the bar for sandbox adventure games. It’s organic in a way almost unseen in any genre, creating an authentic open world that is as cohesive as it is compelling. This title will set the bar for action adventure games for years to come.|I wish there was more I could say about the game. There is so much to discuss, but that would take away from the experience. Avoid spoilers, avoid videos of this game, just buy it, play it, and fall in love with this world the same way I did.|Red Dead Redemption 2 is what we all expected and then some. The game delivers on the fantasy of living as an outlaw in the old west, and may be one of the best open-world games ever made.|Red Dead Redemption 2 offers a world and a story so well crafted that it sometimes makes you forget you're in a video game.  It's an instant classic, that will be talked about for a long time to come.|Red Dead Redemption 2 may not be perfect, but its minor shortcomings are like tiny blemishes on a stunningly beautiful face. In a way, they only serve as a reminder of how this world isn't made for perfection. Every single aspect of the game will put you into the very shoes of an outlaw roaming America with his gang as they try to escape the law long enough to make the money needed to disappear for good. It's an epic, memorable and engrossing tale which also elevates the open world genre to new heights with the brand new interaction system, a cast of memorable characters and a ton of high-quality content to play for a long time.|A stunning, elegiac western that features some of Rockstar's best writing to date, Red Dead Redemption 2 is also the studio's finest open-world to date, handcrafted with real, tangible care and attention, defying the boundaries of what a video game can be. Arthur Morgan will also inhabit a special place in your heart, as a likeable, relatable rogue striving to find his way in the world. Good ol' Arthur.|With its amazing open-world, well-written story and deep characters, Red Dead Redemption II is a roller-coaster full of emotions. Controls may feel a bit clunky at times, but still: this is a masterpiece.|While it has some notable but minor flaws, it's hard to argue that Red Dead Redemption 2 is not a masterpiece. The end result of the meticulous detail, wonderful writing and stunning looks is an open world that sets a new bar for believability, and a time and place I can't stop thinking about or wanting to be a part of.|Red Dead Redemption 2 is an excellent prequel, but it's also an emotional, thought-provoking story in its own right, and it's a world that is hard to leave when it's done.|Few worlds are as well-realised as the one Rockstar has created for Red Dead Redemption 2. Thanks to some wonderful scripting and stellar performances, the characters you randomly meet in the wild are captured as well as the ones you spend most of your days around camp. How do you follow Red Dead Redemption? You make Red Dead Redemption 2.|Red Dead Redemption 2 was the first time playing a Rockstar game where my reaction went past interest to investment. I cared about what happened to these people, I cared about their stories and their lives, and there were moments where I was genuinely saddened or excited by what happened to them. And as the story winds toward its various conclusions, I was completely invested in them, hoping for the best, and fearing the worst. For someone there for the story, who wanted a game to feel fun more than they wanted it to feel comprehensive, I was completely absorbed.|Red Dead Redemption 2 is an enjoyable sequel that builds on the foundation of its predecessor, with much to do and plenty to see, all wrapped up in some of the best visuals you've ever seen on a console. With great characters and satisfying action, it's a Wild West worth exploring.|Red Dead Redemption 2’s missteps are few. The autosaving system is a little bit cruel, leading you to replay failed missions not from a pivotal point, but often from the very beginning of the mission or the section; the game should have taken cues from Ubisoft’s Far Cry and implemented far more friendly checkpoint saves. And while horseback riding in this game is largely fantastic, it’s odd to spend so much time tapping a button just to create your horse’s pace. This is intuitive -- but it feels unnecessary at times, too. The entire Red Dead experience, though, feels fantastic overall.|At its best, the story breaks away from the Western genre and plays like a cross between a heist movie, a domestic drama and a political thriller. At its worst, it’s a buddy action comedy. Mercifully, it manages to be more of the former than the latter. [Polygon Recommends]|"

God of War is already a great contender for game of the year and you shouldn't miss it. [Issue#285]|Cory Barlog and his team achieved what many thought impossible – despite having changed almost everything Santa Monica managed to preserve that elusive spark that makes God of War game feel like a God of War game. They created one of the defining titles of the current generation and a technical marvel whose stunning beauty in motion words cannot describe. And there’s one more thing. Barlog’s touching reaction to his masterpiece’s scores shows that even in the world of huge budgets, micropayments, loot boxes and sales forecasts there still is a place for artists who pour their hearts into their work. We need someone to remind us of that once in a while. [06/2018, p.38]|God of War shines with sincerity. It is a true and great masterpiece featuring amazing storytelling and a strong desire to develop its heroes throughout an incredible and generous adventure.|It has been a long time since a game has gripped me like God of War. It's the type of game that when you sit down to play it, hours pass by in the blink of an eye. It's the type of game that you can't put down; you always want to do just one last task. And it's the type of game that when you aren't playing it, you're thinking about playing it. Addictive, engrossing and compelling; it's epic, that's what it is.|With an exceptional story, brilliant acting, superb controls and gorgeous level design, God of War is a masterpiece and is easily the best title on the platform to date, and possibly the generation.|Like Tomb Raider before it, God of War has managed to keep something of its heritage while grounding its previously inaccessible main character and filling the whole experience with depth and feeling.|This brutally violent mythological adventure was the last place I ever thought I’d find deep, meaningful ruminations on what it is to be a father, and the sacrifices involved. God of War is brilliant in ways I never thought games could be. That it’s also perhaps the most highly polished game I’ve ever played, with unsurpassed presentation and mechanics, is actually secondary to the fact that it generated in me the kind of childlike awe I haven’t experienced in decades. I have been writing about video games for almost 20 years now, and in all that time I have never given any game a perfect score. Until now.|Plain and simple, God of War is one of the best games ever. Good luck to the other Game-of-the-Year contenders. The next generation is here.|The best comparison to be made is that Sony Santa Monica took a blockbuster, popcorn action flick and made it an Oscar contender, without sacrificing any of the series’ central DNA. God of War is one of this generation’s crowning achievements and is up there with some of Sony’s best.|God of War joins as the main star of Sony's arsenal of successful exclusive games and there is no doubt that every gamer with a PlayStation 4 system must play it.|God of War is a genre redefining epic, a triumph for SCI Santa Monica, and the single best reason to own a PS4 in 2018.|It’s a triumph in storytelling and design, making it one of the most exceptional experiences gaming has ever seen.|God of War is an absolute marvel of a game, a visual feast filled with immersive gameplay that is one of the must-play titles of 2018.|The new God of War, with its remarkable visuals, living world, superb combat mechanics and mature narration marks the beginning of a new era for the franchise and, dare we say, single player gaming altogether.|Kratos’ new beginning is full of heart, loaded with action and is easily one of the best games of this generation.|I couldn’t help but think of how Santa Monica took the best of GoW as a franchise and melded it beautifully with the most distinguishable designs of other modern games to create something with an immensely potent synergy.|Perhaps most importantly, I didn’t know how much more ground could be covered with Kratos as a character. The new Nordic mythology obviously gives Sony Santa Monica plenty of new material to play with, but it’s the new Kratos that’s responsible for the game’s most striking evolution...God of War grew up, and the result is the best entry in the series.|God of War is that rare game that manages to reinvent itself while still maintaining what made its predecessors such delights to play...A triumph, and well worth your time.

Unlike previous God of War entries, this is one game that I will be thinking about for many, many years to come.|Whether we're talking about the exploration, combat system, or the story, God of War is nothing short of a masterpiece.|Once mastered, God of War’s combat is one of the most rewarding I have tried in a long time. Kratos becomes a hurricane of death and destruction, blocking, shield bashing, slicing, dicing, spinning around and throwing his axe at an enemy further away, while pummeling closer monsters with punches and kicks, and then recalling the weapon to catch two more draugr in the back, before going in for one of the several spectacular finishers. It’s fast, complex, addictive, and exhilarating, but I never once felt like I wasn’t in control.|A tribute to the Fumito Ueda will delight the veterans of the original game same as introduce this classic to the newcomers, who are not tuned on a nostalgic note. An ideal opportunity to improve your video game education and a wonderful experience in the same time. Some clumsy controls and occasionally stubborn camera can’t ruin the great experience.|Despite the non-numerical title suggesting a complete do-over, God of War is thrillingly different. This is more redemption than reinvention, though there is plenty of that too, as Sony Santa Monica levy the weight of Kratos’ past in one of the most gorgeous, spectacular and impactful blockbusters of the generation.|It is rare to play a game so accomplished in everything it sets out to do. God of War is a standard-setter both technologically and narratively. It is a game that, until recently, would have been impossible.|This is how you do a reboot. After Kratos lost his way, Sony Santa Monica has set the God of War on a new path. A more measure, nuanced character, a great supporting cast, an excellent combat system, and some of the best graphics in the PlayStation 4 game to-date add up to a winner.|God of War is, in a single word, holistic. Every aspect is excellent on its own, but more importantly, it all serves and accentuates the larger vision. Some die-hard fans may fear this isn’t really God of War. I suppose they’re right. It’s even better.|It's possibly the best example of what the PS4 has to offer, and I feel like it's going to be one of those games that instantly comes to mind when they think of this console generation...The graphics, sound, combat, world, and plot all come together to make an exquisite package that is a prime example of why games are art and God of War is right up there with the best films and novels when it comes to storytelling.

If you don't have one, you should consider getting one to play this game.|One of PlayStation’s finest moments, Kratos has been reimagined for a new audience while keeping the best bits of what originally made him great.|God of War doesn’t just feel like the next step for the franchise, but for the entire video game industry. Phenomenal visuals, rewarding exploration, and a deep, nuanced combat system contribute to an epic adventure that should be experienced by every human on earth. Santa Monica Studio is taking us all to Valhalla.|God of War is one of those rare titles that define the console generation. Kratos’ fighting has been refined to its very best and the lands of Midgard are filled with wonders of all manner to explore and defeat. It’s been nearly the entire lifespan of the PlayStation 4 console since Kratos has seen new adventure but the wait has been worth it. Santa Monica Studio’s journey is still far from over, but they’ve once again shown why Kratos is one of gaming’s greatest anti-heroes.|From its renewed focus on storytelling, to its stunningly gorgeous world and incredibly satisfying combat, God of War is nothing short of a masterpiece, one that sets a new bar for what can be accomplished in the world of AAA games.|God of War is, simply put, the best PS4 game I have played in the console’s lifecycle. I can’t stop thinking about its world and characters. I had so much fun exploring it and taking on its combat. I wanted more, and the game delivers. After having hesitations about the direction I thought the game was going, I am thrilled to report that all of my concerns were nullified within the first hour of the game. This is the true evolution of the series, and quite possibly the best game of the year. Well at least so far.|God of War has amazed us from the narrative standpoint as well as with its incredible graphics. The new adventures of Kratos redefines the beat’em all genre, and makes the game the best exclusive on the PS4 since its inception.|God of War is an epic reboot of an epic franchise. The evolution of Kratos could have gone horribly wrong. Instead, Santa Monica Studio has given the franchise the treatment it deserves. This new narrative tone has heart, and serves to make Kratos much more relatable in his new role as protector, while remaining as brutal as past installments. Reworked and improved combat options make for an enjoyable and customizable experience, and phenomenal audiovisual performance ensures that each trip to the mythical lands before the Vikings is a wonderfully grisly experience. God of War is a must-buy experience well worth the wait.|God of War is a special game. This reimagining of the famous PlayStation franchise elevates the series in unexpected ways, without forgetting the core tenets that made Kratos a fan-favourite to begin with. This is a sprawling single player epic with an abundance of secrets and a storyline that keeps you hooked from start-to-finish. While it borrows liberally from other action adventure greats, its unique combat and outstanding artistic direction separate it from its immediate peers. A truly impressive achievement.|God of War is the best example of how you should manage the beginning of a new era for an established brand, in every entertainment media. It’s the pinnacle of Sony’s will to promote creative freedom for its first party studios. It’s a melting pot made of old school video game elements and technical mastery, a great script and revolutionary ideas.|God of War is an astonishing achievement in the series, a magnificent and deep game that plays quite differently but greatly and succeeds in absolutely every aspect. The action is great, the exploration is great, the story is great, the characters - who are remarkably played - are great, the setting is wonderful, the music is truly special: players can't turn their back on this absolute work of art.|It’s very rare that a game grabs me this completely, but God of War is, without a doubt, an early contender for Game of the Year. It’s flawless in its execution, and the new benchmark for action titles. Well done, Santa Monica Studios, and thanks for taking us on this entirely new adventure.|One of the best games on PS4, and one of the best games of this generation.  A masterpiece.|I expected great action from God of War, and it delivers that handily. But I didn’t expect it to be a thrilling journey in which every aspect of it complements the others to form what is nothing short of a masterpiece. It’s a game in which Kratos, a previously one-note character, becomes a complex father, warrior, and monster, embattled both on the field and within his own heart about how to treat his son; one in which the world opens up and shifts, offering rewards in both gameplay and knowledge of its lore that I treasured with each accomplishment. The obvious care that went into crafting its world, characters, and gameplay delivers by far the most stirring and memorable game in the series.|God of War is back with one of the most rewarding experiences on the PlayStation 4 to date.|Sony Santa Monica has made it clear that there’s more story to tell, and I hope the exact same team is able to tell it.|God of War is an excellent game that has evolved with great quality in every aspect. The game feels more mature, profound and solid than we have ever seen in the saga. Its gameplay is still dynamic and its story will keep us in the edge of our seats from beginning to end. However, it lacks magic in some moments and has a few repetitive bosses, which does not allow this game to reach the perfect score.|In conclusion, the game has a very good score, thanks to its excellent graphical quality, its impeccable sound and its very entertaining dynamics of gameplay. Both fans and new players of God of war will be pleased to see that the game offers a universe of mythology that offers one of the best gaming experiences that has come to the PlayStation 4.|At first, we were skeptical about the prospect of open world in God of War, but Santa Monica Studio managed to avoid the typical pitfalls. Here, you won’t find a list of watchtowers to visit, outposts to clear, swarms of respawning enemies to kill. Not to mention that side-quests are far better than typical “kill 10 somethings” stuff. [Issue#229, p.38]|God of War has a far grander scale than either Horizon Zero Dawn or The Last of Us and tugs on different emotional heartstrings while still making you care about the cast. This is the best incarnation of Kratos yet and one of the finest experiences on the PlayStation 4.|This is a God of War game, and it’s f.cking brilliant. It has old-school game-design coupled lovingly alongside a modern storytelling tilt, and it marries the two in a contemporary and meaningful way. And playing on PS4 Pro on a setup like my Samsung QLED 65” Q8C with HDR, it just screams quality.|God of War is all you can ask from a new game in a franchise; very high production values, charismatic characters and satisfying combat, visceral with no lack of action. However, this is accompanied by a very well-told story, excellent animation, a very interesting new universe, fun gameplay and a partner that develops a very promising personality. You can feel the dedication and care that Santa Monica Studio put into every frame of this game. Despite going in a new direction, God of War somehow manages to feel familiar and it is a worthy beginning of a new saga that surely has a lot to give us in the future.|Kratos’ reinvention serves as a narrative hook, but it also parallels the series’ evolution as a whole; where God of War once relied on bombast and bloodlust, now it leaves space for strategy and nuance. It still has superb action and plenty of jaw-dropping moments, but it supports them with a new level of depth and maturity. God of War learns from its past while clearing an exciting path for the future, and emerges as one of the best games of this generation.|PlayStation boasts a new and wonderful exclusive that will be difficult to match and, of course, it seems that it gives way to a new saga within the wonderful universe of Kratos. It is not enough to be ambitious. The most important thing is to know how to land those ambitions.|God of War is a successful reboot of one of the most brutal hack-and-slash action games, and it's remarkable, fun and still uber-violent. The core gameplay has changed significantly, and Santa Monica did take a risk that won't appeal to some orthodox God of War fans. But all in all it turns out that those new game mechanics are so well-crafted and of course it's great progress.|God of War is the best thing that has happened to PlayStation 4 since Bloodborne. Nothing is out of place, nothing is ordinary. The art direction is amazingly inspired, the combat system is really deep and engaging, and everything on screen is, hands down, unlike anything else you have ever seen on the PlayStation 4. Honestly, there's no reason not to play this new masterpiece from Santa Monica Studio.|Every single aspect in God of War works perfectly in order to create a violent, yet moving masterpiece. Probably the best looking game on current gen consoles and a deep story, whose only weak point is that we get the feeling that the best is yet to come.|God of War is a true revolution to the franchise. The heartwarming dynamic between Kratos and Atreus is even more intense because of the fluid camera that shows action, drama and silence in an incredible way.|Where most games excel in one single area, God of War manages to deliver on every front, providing players with one of the best experiences we’ve seen so far this generation.|A few insignificant nitpicks aside, this is a prime example of a modern slasher, a crown jewel of this genre, a new definitive killer app for PlayStation 4.|God of War is one of the most sublimely constructed action games of all time. It may lack a little of Souls' depth, but this is more than made up for with bombastic appeal, setpiece variety, and top-tier storytelling.|God of War has never been so good.|God of War is the fourth ""main"" game in the franchise, but in so many aspects is also a first and by far a better game than the rest of them. Good story, great gameplay and fantastic voice acting make GoW something really special.|God of War takes everything good about the franchise and elevates it. Almost every aspect is polished to a fine sheen, with a particular standout being the world itself, and the new emphasis on telling a mature and meaningful story that explores remarkably complex themes. God of War sets a new bar for storytelling and world building in games, and transforms Kratos from a one note character to a fascinating man with a story worth hearing. If you have a PS4, this is a must have title.|The Gods here are more human then they've ever been, and there's something as captivating about that as there was about the larger-than-life absurdity of characters like Poseidon and Hades in the original series. God of War works for what it keeps and works for what it changes. It's a foundation for a series that's suddenly a tentpole once again.|Santa Monica has achieved to modernize, expand and rescue all what did God of War a great experience. It mixes a more technical and refined combat with a narrative sensitivity that enrich the saga. One of the most complete and shocking experience in the year so far.|God of War has changed. This new Nordic chapter transforms the series into an impressive action/adventure, allowing us to rediscover the value of exploration. Yet the soul of God of War is still intact: and emerges, in all its imperious power, during the brutal fights and the violent clashes. As the main story progresses and the optional contents unfolds, God of War affirms itself as one of the most dense, surprising and rich adventure of the last three generations. It overwhelms the market with a force that leaves you speechless.|God of War is one of the best action game of this generation. Everything is at the right place, the combat-system is extremely engaging and the story is super. A game that brings new life to a series that obviously had something more to tell.|The God of War series has undergone a fantastic transformation. I'll miss the fixed camera and tales of revenge that previous titles provided but this new evolution makes for a far superior and profound experience.

Kratos’ new beginning is masterfully written, emotionally resot, and a thrilling challenge.|A fascinating story, sublime mechanics, and a beautiful world come together in an experience that is about as confident of a step forward as the God of War series could make.|This is a skull-smashing story about making mistakes and taking responsibility. While hacking and slashing their enemies, a father and son build bonds of love and loyalty. God of War is a minor masterpiece.|The new God of War brings back Kratos in a superb fashion. Santa Monica studio should do the same for a potential sequel and I won’t be able to worry about my favorite hero. The game is bold in introducing some radical changes to the series’ formula but if you stop looking back you’ll know – this is an excellent game in every way.|God of War isn’t just a great God of War game, it’s the best so far. Sony Santa Monica has clearly put love into this latest title of the series and has given both longtime fans and newcomers a monumental gaming achievement. Put your fears to rest – yes, Kratos is getting older, but even after all this time, he’s better than ever.|Kratos returns with an epic action adventure that redefines some aspects the series but keeps its essence intact.|The worlds are beautiful, the combat system is fun throughout, and the story remains exciting.

It is enchantingly beautiful, has a well written story, great characters and convincing combat. It would have been perfect if only God of War would have just a bit more of the overwhelming boss fights it sparsely throws at you.|Of all the iterations of Kratos I've seen over the lifetime of the God of War series, Old Man Kratos is probably my favorite. His newest adventure might not have quite the same wall-to-wall bombast as the ones that came before, but he's added a new dimension to his personality. He can only stay Old Testament-angry for so long, and the table is definitely set for more installments. There's more to explore now in this new corner of mythology, and it'll be compelling to see if he burns everything to the ground or finds an even higher place to go.|God of war is an example of a great reboot. Intense and violent as its predecessors, the new combat mechanics, point of view and nordic mythology are solid arguments to declare it one of the best PS4 exclusives. And amazing starting point for the future of the series.|An excellent, essential update of a PlayStation icon. Kratos has never been more relevant or relatable. [June 2018, p.72]|Forget any fears you had. Kratos makes a truly triumphant return in what proves to be his best game yet. Every change - the addition of Atreus included - is for the better, while every non-negotiable tradition is perfected. [Issue#149, p.74]|God of War is nothing short of sensational. It improves on the best aspects of the previous entries in the franchise while also providing a fresh take on what should feel like a tired and worn series by now. Truly essential gaming if you love great gameplay, narrative and stellar presentation.|It's a game of two halves, God of War. For the first dozen or so hours you may find yourself frustrated by the slow levelling up, a bewildering map system, and perplexing storyline stuffed with gated areas and treasures. Stick with it, though; the more you do, the more of the realms you'll open... and that's where the fun REALLY begins... Like Kratos, this game gets better with time. [Issue#200, p.70]|God of War isn’t a perfect game, but it’s exactly the kind of reinvention the series needed. This game is a must own. If you own a PlayStation 4 and are even remotely interested, you owe it to yourself to pick it up.|That the gorgeous visuals as well as the revamped fighting mechanics would deliver, was foreseeable. But I wouldn’t have thought possible, that story and direction would reach these heights from beginning to end. An inventive reimagination of one of Sony’s most durable heroes.|Judged as a pure technical showpiece, as a demonstration of art design, or as a work of popular entertainment the new God of War succeeds mightily.|God of War feels ambitious in the best kind of way: the messy kind. It’s not afraid to get its hands dirty digging at something it thinks is interesting, while knowing it might not find it at that moment. It’s fine with not telling you everything, or with dialing back on the usual tropes of loud music, brutal violence, and hamfisted emotional manipulation.|God of War feels like a breath of fresh air, thanks to a reimagined world and some deeper customization features. But at the root of the game is the classic God of War combat, slightly less gory but only slightly less grisly. Tearing monsters apart bare-handed is just as much of a rush as it ever was. And that's good, because even if it's time to grow up, it's okay not to change too much.|In crafting a thoughtful fable about a man contending with surpassing his sins to keep them from his child, the new God of War has already transcended its bloody roots.|God of War achieves a very impressive balance between the epic and the mundane, between the ultra violent and the domestic. It's undoubtedly the coolest and most interesting God of War to date.|Kratos is back and he brought his son. The setting is new as are most of the aspects of the game. You get to wreak havoc in a stunning open world full of new enemies and other surprises. The Norse gods better hide!|The beloved God of War franchise certainly makes a sharp turn. But not for the worse, as this game packs all the looks, terrific gameplay and memorable characters needed to make it a true, frost-riddled gem.|A top-to-bottom revamp of the whole God Of War franchise that matches thrilling, if slightly shallow, combat and exploration with some impressively trenchant storytelling.|God of War is the new technical benchmark on the console and it's a concrete step forward for the series in terms of gameplay, narrative structure and lore. We're not so sure about its combat system and its lack of enemy variety.|Kratos is no longer seeking revenge, but rather redemption. He feels multidimensional for the first time. As a dad, I sometimes found myself rooting for and even identifying with him on a gut level, especially as I watched him make some obvious parenting mistakes.|God Of War is a cinematic masterpiece that manages to reinvent and push an already fantastic series to new heights. Barring some pacing issues in its narrative, Sony Santa Monica has breathed new life into Kratos and the God of War series, and I can't wait to see what's next.|Kratos has returned in a beautiful new adventure. Forget all previous iterations, this game sets the new franchise standard in which story, combat and exploration are expertly interwoven in spectacular fashion. The game looks and plays stellar while the voice acting is of mind-blowing quality. Atreus is a great addition and together with the new approach to gameplay the latest PlayStation 4 God of War game feels like a breath of fresh air. An unmissable must-play.|The developers took the series in a new direction focusing more on cinematics while still providing a satisfying amount of action. The resulting mix of beautiful visuals, emotional story and engaging gameplay makes God of War as epic as it ever was.|God of War tells a wonderful tale through a beautiful spectrum speckled with more than a few drops of the blood of your enemies. It’s a shame, then, that boss fights have fallen by the wayside at every level to become terribly monotonous – but if that’s the cost of what Santa Monica has built, it’s certainly a price worth paying...The ending isn’t as grand I’d hoped for, but the setting up of a sequel makes up for this – and there’s still plenty left to do in the Lake of Nine. God of War is the best in the series.|God of War on the PlayStation 4 has taken me completely by surprise. As a game that follows on from the old games, but somehow turns it completely on its head and makes it a world worth investing time into feels almost like a miracle. It is one of those games that takes Norse mythology as a core idea and treats it with respect, while also integrating it seamlessly into the story and making it important to the narrative. I have a newfound interest in learning more about Norse mythology, and it truly makes a game special when it encourages the player to learn more beyond the scope of the game itself.|While there's still gore and violence by the corpse-load, this cinematic adventure feels far more reminiscent of the father-daughter relationship in The Last of Us than the testosterone-soaked Devil May Cry challenger the franchise started as.|God of War is a fantastic game in every way imaginable. It offers an amazing world, balanced combat and an emotional story - this is one of the best PS4 exclusives.|God of War is an exhilarating, beautiful action game that turns one of PlayStation's biggest icons into a character you can care about.|In many ways God of War is what the series has always been. It's a spectacular action game with epic set pieces, big-budget production values, and hard-hitting combat that grows more feverish and impressive as you progress. What may surprise you is how mature its storytelling has become. Like Kratos, God of War recalls the past while acknowledging the need to improve. Everything new it does is for the better, and everything it holds onto benefits as a result. Kratos is no longer a predictable brute. God of War is no longer an old-fashioned action series. With this reboot, it confidently walks a new path that will hopefully lead to more exciting adventures to come.|Vengeance may not be what Kratos seeks anymore, but that has done little to stop the God of War franchise. Santa Monica Studios have successfully transplanted the Ghost of Sparta to a new world with a new mythology and given the formula the revamp it needed.|God of War very effectively achieves its mission to be a good reboot of the saga and a good sequel. Each one of the days of the five years of development of this new delivery is evident in the great values of production in each one of the sections, materializing  perfectly in the constant sequence plane. Perhaps we only regret not having been presented with something truly original mechanically and not a mixture of ingredients that we have seen in other titles.|God of War has seen considerable changes across the board from previous games in the series, but almost all of them feel like they were for the better.|Thoughtful in both its presentation and its mechanics, to simply say God of War surpasses the games that came before it would not do it justice. It takes a dormant franchise, one that’s worse for wear, and uses that baggage to create one of the most compelling experiences we’ve played in a long time.|God of War is definitely good, but some aspects lack a certain depth that will make them interesting enough to turn it into a great game. There's a very meaningful armor and weapon upgrade system that allows you to increase your power level to make fights easier, but many of the skills you unlock throughout your journey feel absolutely useless.|God of War is a breathtaking adventure with lots to offer to hardcore gamers. It’s a good game that could have been great with a refined story, better characters and more variety in its combats.|The real star is the fluid combat, realistic visuals, and the rousing set-pieces. It is unclear how far the PlayStation 4's architecture is being pushed, but it wouldn't be surprising if God of War is pushing it to its absolute limit because there is never a moment when it does not look stunning. There is a so much to like that the weaker aspects get drowned out and easily ignored and pulling that off is no easy feat.|Sure, the prospect of spending 30 hours with gaming's grumpiest anti-hero and his bratty kid might not sound like fun, but by the time the pair have finally completed their exhilarating, exhausting journey, you'll be delighted you joined them. [June 2018, p.104]|God of War's reboot is a triumph...Our few complaints – and there are very few – would be that the boat sections add little to the actual gameplay other than a cumbersome way to explore the world. Meanwhile, upgrading Kratos' gear sometimes means battling some eye-wateringly tiny text and over-complicated power-ups.|God of War takes a classic franchise and reshapes it into the modern fold. The end result is a dramatic, polished, visually impressive and somewhat by-the-numbers PS4 blockbuster that slots along nicely beside the other exclusives in the console's library. It has plenty of content and fairly robust combat to entertain newcomers, while fans of the original games will likely enjoy the second half of the adventure a bit more.|Sony Santa Monica has turned its established formula on its head and created a core loop and setting with tremendous potential.|Though it isn’t perfect, the game excels at nearly everything it sets out to do. Full of genuine surprises, thrilling action, and emotionally grounded in almost every moment, this God of War is easily the best entry in a long series that had no right to reinvent itself so well.|A lot of what goes into God of War feels as though it was cherry-picked from the modern gaming zeitgeist. The semi-open world structure, loot system, and a much deeper narrative focus work well, but are all trends being pushed by most other big games. As a result, God of War can feel slightly homogenised in a way that some fans may find unappealing. Thankfully, a strong sense of setting and brutally satisfying combat help maintain that God of War identity. If it wasn't made abundantly clear already, this is the first in what will most likely be a new trilogy for the God of War franchise, and this first instalment serves as a pretty great foundation.|Despite all my complaints about Atreus and the game's imperfections, this is still an easy game to recommend to anyone with a PS4. God of War marks the glorious and bloody return of everyone's favorite Spartan, and with the new dive into Norse mythology, there's still plenty of adventures to look forward to as the series evolves.|It’s ironic that a story about the value of discipline and restraint would feel like it needs more time in the editing room, but that’s the new God of War – promising but aimless. I like the new Kratos, but I hope his next adventure is more focused than this, and I pray that it actually gives him something interesting to do.|I went into the new God of War expecting a cheesy, mindless action game with a lot of flash and pizzazz. Instead, I got one of the most thoughtful and well-constructed reboots since Tomb Raider, with plenty of story beats and images that will stick with me for a while. It's not a revolutionary standout in its genre, but the new God of War is still a solid example of how to reinvent a well-loved series for a new generation without ruining what came before.|It’s bravura game-making – a single-shot production that extends across 30-or-more hours, boasting some peerless direction and wonderful performances. The cinematic decision to keep everything in one continuous shot, the camera constantly in motion, means you never leave Kratos’ side. It’s a choice that makes for the most personal God Of War to date, perhaps the most personal game of its kind.|God of War is a staggering achievement in gaming -- the sort of must-play title that we only we get two or three times in a console's lifespan.|Despite eye-catching changes, the heart of this series remains gloriously unaltered. [Recommended]|It feels like more of a trend follower than a trendsetter, a pastiche of ideas. But they are good ideas, done well enough to bring a once-stale series back up from the depths of Helheim.|The shortcomings do little to mar the overall experience, and most only become evident after you've spent 30 or 40 hours in this dazzling world. God of War is a special game. It's the sort of experience that people are going to be talking about for months to come, with a story that hits you right in the feels and smooth, beautifully staged gameplay that clicks immediately like a familiar, old friend.|It’s a surprisingly emotional story for one of gaming’s most emotionally stunted characters, told with care and wrapped in a production that’s a flat-out technical marvel, visually spectacular from start to finish and captured with an omnipresent, unflinching camera that makes it look unlike anything we’ve seen before.|It's pretty good, I'll say that much. I don't think it's the most brilliant game in the world. It's not having me crying tears of joy. But it's nice to play a game with a sense of a beginning, middle, and end, a game with a sense of pacing. A game that does have its open explore able areas...It's just nice to play a game that feels like a game, more than a service.|On their own, the various elements that make up God of War don’t sound especially unique or interesting. But it’s the way they work together — how the story informs the action and vice versa — that makes it memorable. God of War takes a one-dimensional series and turns it into something with depth and emotion.|The new God of War is a departure from its predecessors that gives the player more without making any compromises. It’s challenging, beautiful, brutal, rewarding, and even a bit funny on occasion. Whether you’re a fan of the series or not, it’s well worth your time.|Kratos remains capable of startling violence. But there is a sense that even Sony Santa Monica has recoiled from some of “God of War’s” legacy, and the game is better for it. It is a game that treats its history with respect where appropriate, but without obligation, even in its very concluding moments. This new God of War has some rough edges remaining in its transition to something new, but even in its concluding moments, it commits to its vision in a way that few games do — and it’s the first time the series has felt vibrant and important in a decade.|God of War has grown up. It is violent, but it’s not excessive. It is angry, but there is something to contrast it against. There is a flash of nipple, but it’s Kratos’s. Kratos is older, and he feels remorse for his past, but it feels like Sony Santa Monica also wants to atone. If that was God of War’s goal, the studio deserves a standing ovation. This isn’t only the best God of War game, it’s one of the best games of the current generation.|Somehow, in a game about gods fighting other gods, God of War feels grounded. And because of some of the new directions it moves the series in, it has the room to explore this mythological family drama. By giving God of War small stake tension, the whole thing benefits."

Its mix of reactionary platforming and problem solving is a breath of fresh air. Its Assist Mode is ahead of the curb in an industry constantly discussing accessibility. The way it masterfully weaves its emotional story about mental health with its brutal difficulty is astounding. Hours of extra content, one of the best soundtracks of all time and neat art is only the icing on the cake for this indie gem.|Celeste is undoubtedly a modern masterpiece.

The way it masterfully weaves its emotional story about mental health with its brutal difficulty is astounding. Hours of extra content, one of the best soundtracks of all time and neat art is only the icing on the cake for this indie gem.|Celeste is ... like heaven. The level design is fantastic, artistically takes your breath away and playability is perfect. It's highly complicated, especially after the first round, but very satisfying. Celeste itself explains why ""indie games"" exist.|The frustration of dying for the thousandth time finds its counterweight in the gorgeously fluid ballet of a perfect run. With a wonderfully evocative soundtrack and a whole host of creative ideas and plenty of additional challenges beyond the main campaign, Celeste manages to cram in a whole lot of goodness without ever missing a step. Fans of tricky platformers will find much to love in the game's design, but it's also a perfect starting point for anyone new to the genre — perhaps even those actively averse to it. In short, it's a bit of a masterpiece.|Simply put, Celeste is a tour de force. A piece of work that will no doubt go down as one of the year’s best platformers or even just one of its best games in general. Between the immaculately crafted levels with a wide variety of challenges, the intense gameplay that rewards crackerjack timing, the sheer amount of post-game content and things to discover in every chapter, and a moving, amazing story in the form of Madeline’s urge to climb the behemoth that awaits her, what we have here is truly magnificent and an experience that simply cannot be missed. And hey, word has it that the view from the top is amazing.|Overall Celeste is a phenomenal game. While the game delivers on all fronts, the relatable story and soundtrack stand out as two of the most memorable aspects. The challenging platforming helps to keep the player motivated to push forward. The discussions between Madeline and side characters to the game help the world around you feel alive, and their guidance helps Madeline to continue pushing forward. Celeste is not a game for everyone. The difficulty alone is something to easily turn players away. To those who are looking for a challenging platformer with a rewarding story, Celeste is definitely a one of a kind diamond in the rough.|The greatest triumph of Celeste is that its best-in-class jumping and dashing is blended beautifully with an important and sincere story and an incredible soundtrack that make it a genuinely emotional game, even when your feet are planted firmly on the ground.|Developer Matt Makes Games’ previous release was TowerFall, the archery-themed four-player battle royale. With its single-player focus and touching narrative, Celeste might seem like an odd follow-up. However, like TowerFall, Celeste features polished and intense action that makes it easy to love and hard to put down.|The best indie platformer since Super Meat Boy, but also one of the best storytelling experiences of recent years – with an incisive and thoughtful portrayal of mental illness.|Celeste offers a bold and beautiful story that will touch anyone who can relate to its plot foundation. It’s a brilliantly designed and gorgeously presented experience throughout the entirety of play. Perhaps Celeste’s greatest achievement, however, is that it appeals to speedrunners, thrill seekers, and completionists alike. Furthermore, it doesn’t alienate genre newcomers thanks to how accessible it is.|Celeste surprised us with its tight and challenging but very rewarding gameplay, coupled with a deep story and great level design. Sometimes you can feel lost in the game's vast areas and it could have used a more diversified gameplay, but it's definitely a game to have for lovers of 2D platform games.|"

Once you get over its primitive aesthetic, you’ll soon realise why everyone else has been so captivated by Toby Fox’s creation.|What else can I say? Undertale is spectacular, even three years later. It’s a game that deserves every bit of praise that it receives, and a game that the people who love it are going to remember for a long, long time. I can’t express how happy I am to have had the opportunity to experience it again on the Switch.|If you haven't played Undertale before, you will want to pick this Switch version up to experience what everyone's talking about for yourself. [Issue #36 – November/December 2018, p. 17]|Sure, the music is infectious to the point where I'd find myself humming it days later. Yes, the dialogue is stunningly well-written. Meeting and experiencing the varied cast is a delight, since you never know what will come next. And okay, yeah, there are countless little touches and fleeting moments that would make me stop and appreciate what was happening. And that's the real secret about Undertale. There isn't one thing that makes it special, because everything makes it special. It has a heart, a soul.|Toby Fox's work is not just an anecdote: it is perfectly well-thought out. It hides something that connects directly or indirectly to anyone who has spent too much time with a gamepad in his hands.|The game is every bit as charming, challenging, and harrowing as it was the first time around.|Going through the experience today, it’s easy to see why Undertale was the talk of the town two years ago. It’s not an overly long playthrough, but it’s an impactful 7+ hours. A slow burn that starts off cute, but builds up to an absolutely thrilling last couple hours. I’m not sure if the Pope has gotten around to playing it yet, but he would be doing himself a disservice if he hasn’t.|Undertale is a brilliant and smartly designed game that understands well what makes a good RPG work; so much so that it can upend expectations and deliver something that’s almost a satire of the genre. It’s been a long time since we’ve played a game that manages to surprise so often and in so many unique ways, and even if it doesn’t look like much, Undertale has way more going for it under the surface. Excellently written characters, a genre-bending battle system and a solid soundtrack make this one an easy recommendation, especially to RPG lovers. Do yourself a favour and give this one a download.|"
